# Game Over

You’ve reached the end of the book, for now. As mentioned at the start, this is the early access version of the book, and there’s a lot of work still pending. The existing chapters need to be cleaned up a bit to become more readable, and a few new chapters are yet to be added.

That said, what you’ve read so far covers the basics of what to expect from being involved with the video game industry, either as a consumer, a developer, or a content creator. 

The appendices that follow this chapter will provide additional information about some of the topics covered in the book.
