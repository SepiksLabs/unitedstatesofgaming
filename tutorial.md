# Tutorial

Imagine that the video game industry was a country of its own. For argument’s sake, this country does not have any physical boundaries, and is  set up entirely in a virtual environment. 

Right away, it’s interesting to note that this would be the largest country in the world in terms of population, with over 3 billion citizens.

For any country to function efficiently, especially one with such a large population, it has to rely on the co-operation between its numerous states, which usually operate independent of each other. 

The same holds true for the video game country, which has several different states, each of which offer a different experiences to their citizens. 

As the guy who discovered this imaginary nation, I am here to introduce you to these various states, and tell you a bit more about how they function. In no particular order, here are the states that I have discovered so far, along with a brief note about each one.

**Personal Computing**

One of the most technologically advanced states, its  residents like using modular components to keep changing the computers that they use to play games.

**PlayStation**

A fairly prosperous state, folks here usually like to embark upon cinematic adventures that include emotional narratives. 

**Xbox**

This state used to be quite prosperous, but owing to a lack of innovation, it has recently seen a lot of its residents migrate to the *PC* and *PlayStation* states. 

**Nintendo**

This state is reputed for being quite suitable for families to move in, but it is also quite isolated from the rest of the nation, with a government that largely does its own thing, ignoring the latest trends taking place in other states.

**Mobile**

The largest and most prosperous state in the country, it brings in the most revenue and has new people flocking into its largest cities, *App Store* and *Play Store* every single day.

**Alternate Reality**

A relatively new state, currently still under construction. The researchers here are trying to build products that let their users enjoy virtual and/or augmented reality experiences. 

**Neighbouring Islands**

*Retro Gaming*, *Real Money Gaming*, *Board Gaming*

These are a group of smaller islands that are quite distant from the mainland, but are still related to the video game nation.  They occasionally share resources such as technology and personnel from the mainland, but essentially exist on their own.

The goal of all these states is the production and distribution of various kinds of entertainment and simulation products, that we commonly know as video games. Each state tries to add its own unique flavour to the kind of games produced, but these days, they are all starting to blend in together.

This book explores the functioning of these states in detail and gives a taste of what it is like to live in the land of video games. If you only have time to read one chapter of this book, then let it be this one. It provides a shorter version of the story narrated throughout the book.

It all comes down to understanding how video games are produced, and later distributed.

# Categories

First, we need to understand what kind of games are available out there. Video games come in different shapes and sizes. In the 1990s, when the time came to name the various categories of games, some genius thought it would be a good idea to take inspiration from the finance industry. 

In that industry, they have a practice of assigning a rating to certain investment instruments, based on their health and the risk associated with them. In particular, for an instrument called *bonds*, the highest rating available is known as *AAA*. 

Bonds that are given this rating are considered to be the best in the market, as well as the safest. 

So, our unknown genius thought it would be a good idea to give a similar rating to games that are considered to be the best in the market, as well as the safest. That’s how we ended up with a category of games called *AAA Games.* They usually require huge teams of people and large budgets to be produced.

Of course, the name aged poorly, and today, AAA games are rarely considered the best in the market, and they carry the largest risk possible for the publishers who invest in them, because these games can require hundreds of millions of dollars in development costs, several years of development time, and when they come to the market, they can still flop spectacularly. However, you know how these things work. Once something has been given a name, it sticks. 

Worse, it paves the road for similar names. That’s how we ended up with a category called *AA Games.* They have smaller team and budget requirements, but they are still expected to deliver a high-quality experience to the players.

If you guessed that the next tier of games would be called *A Games*, you would be…incorrect. The folks in the industry finally decided it was time to stop using those silly terms, and came up with a slightly better name for the next tier: *Indie Games.*

Short for *independent games*, Indie games are usually (but not always) developed by small, independent teams, sometimes consisting of a single person doing everything. Their independence allows them to try new and unique ideas. More importantly, the budgets are usually minuscule. So, if the game fails to recoup its budget, the losses would be smaller compared to when a AAA game fails. 

And in recent years, the quality of Indie games has improved significantly, growing from rough, unpolished prototypes to impressive, realistic gaming experiences. In short, Indie games are now capable of being the best in the market, while carrying the least risk. Perhaps the category is due for a name change.

# Platforms

Once the type of game has been selected, the next step in the production process is to decide where the game is going to be made available. This is where the major states come in. For the sake of simplicity, let us call them *platforms*, for they provide the required means for these games to run. 

We have already been introduced to them, but here they are again, to save you the trouble of turning back the pages. These are the various platforms on which video games are distributed.

- PC (currently includes the standard *Personal Computers* that run Windows, as well as those that run Linux and Mac operating systems)
- PlayStation (currently includes the *PlayStation 4* and *PlayStation 5* consoles)
- Xbox (currently includes the *Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S*, and *Xbox One* consoles)
- Nintendo (currently includes the *Nintendo Switch* console)
- Mobile (currently includes various *iPhone* and *Android* smartphone models)
- VR/AR (currently includes virtual/augmented reality devices such as the *Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Meta Quest*, and *PlayStation VR*)

Except for the VR/AR platform, games released on the other platforms can technically be released on every other platform as well, provided the platform holders allow it. Who are these mysterious *platform holders*, you wonder? They are the corporations that either own certain platforms outright, or have such a dominant presence on a particular platform that other entities have little chance of succeeding. We shall learn more about these platform holders in a later chapter.

# Distribution

Once the games have been produced, they are distributed on each platform’s dedicated storefront. Some platforms may have multiple stores, but as mentioned before, they always have a dominant force which overshadows the others. Here are the important storefronts where the majority of games are released on each platform.

- Steam (largest storefront for PC)
- PlayStation Store
- Xbox Store
- Nintendo eShop
- Apple App Store/Google Play Store (largest storefronts for iPhones/Android phones respectively)
- Meta Quest Store/Viveport (dedicated stores for Meta Quest/HTC Vive headsets respectively)

# Money

Producing and distributing games is the largest source of revenue for the people who own and run the platforms, but what about regular citizens?

As it turns out, there are other means of making money in the video game nation, all of which are directly or indirectly related to the games themselves. Further details about these can be found in the gigantic chapter dedicated to making money, but here’s a brief list of all the ways in which one can make an honest living in this nation.

- Game development (includes the various opportunities available in game development and publishing)
- Game distribution (includes running retail stores and subscription services)
- Competitive gaming (includes being an esports athlete, as well as taking up numerous other roles in the wider esports industry)
- Content Creation (includes game streaming and creating game related content on various social networks such as Twitch, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok)
- Product Creation (includes the creation and sale of licensed merchandise related to video game characters and themes, as well as any other toys or products related to video games)

Apart from these, there are other, lesser known careers, such as those revolving around providing support to developers and content creators. 

# History

The video game nation has a rich history, going back all the  way back to 1958. The industry got a formal start in 1972, and has been consistently producing video games ever since then. Today, the video game industry is collectively larger than any other entertainment industry in the rest of the world. 

To learn more about the storied history of video games, turn to the chapter that is helpfully named, *History*.

# Next Steps

This brief chapter was but a taste of the delights that the video game nation has to offer. Throughout the rest of this book, we will explore various aspects of this industry, learning more about how games are made, the lifestyle of people who play games regularly, the various risks one may face while playing games, and a glance at the history, as well as future of the industry.

If you are impatient and skip to the end of the book, you will find a few appendices that provide several lists containing all sorts of tidbits about the industry.

Now, if you’re ready to embark on this exciting journey to learn about video games, strap in your seat belts, and…well, turn to the next page.
