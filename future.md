# Future

Predicting the future can be a fun thing to do, but it’s important not to take anyone’s predictions too seriously, even if they are backed by a lot of data. 

That’s because there is almost always at least one major thing that comes seemingly out of nowhere, and shakes up the status quo.

For instance, few could have predicted in 2014 that trends such as Blockchain technology and Artifical Intelligence would be influencing major industries in 2024. The latter, especially, came seemingly out of nowhere, although we now know that the foundation for developing generative AI models was laid long ago. 

In any case, predicting the future *is* a bit of fun, which is why this chapter exists. These are more of educated guesses as to the direction in which the video game industry is headed, based on where we are right now.

## Impact

There are more than 3 billion active gamers in the world in 2024. These include people who play games casually on their mobile phones, people who own dedicated gaming consoles or PCs, and people who pursue gaming as a serious career option. 

One of the safest guesses is that the number of people who indulge in gaming as a hobby or career will only continue to go up, as new markets and previously untapped audiences discover this industry.

Currently, the average age of a gamer is around 35 years. As this number goes up, there may be an increase in demand for more mature games, that explore various aspects of our society and culture. 

While other media such as books, movies, music, and TV are also expected to grow, the interactive nature of video games will no doubt attract the attention of future generations, leading to a sharp rise in the number of gamers.

This growth will not be without challenges. In the present, the industry is facing issues with the rising cost of hardware, as well as the rising cost of developing games.  AAA games are now requiring hundreds of millions of development costs, along with 3-5 years of development time. It is simply not feasible for studios to keep developing games that require as much time as half the life cycle of a home console to launch. 

In order to meet the demands of a growing audience, there needs to be a major shift in the development strategy of games, especially those at the highest tier of production. 

There might be other challenges as well, especially in the area of monetising games. If the industry doesn’t give up on the predatory monetisation tactics that are currently in use right now, then we risk alienating a large number of people from the medium entirely. 

In the mid 2010s, when the *lootbox* system was popularly being used by many AAA productions, the threat of being banned in several nations prompted publishers to change their tactic and switch to the *battle pass* model. So, there is a bit of hope that the industry is open to change, even if that is brought about by threat of cancellation. Battle passes and the seasonal model may not seem as dangerous on the surface as lootboxes, but they are quite harmful in the long run, given the  collective human time that they end up wasting each year. 

The uneasy relationship between the mobile gaming market and the traditional PC/Console market will continue to remain awkward, with the younger mobile market continuing to reach more users and bringing in more revenue. I suspect that traditional game publishers are already aware of this fact, and we may see more investments into the mobile market by some of these older companies. 

Speaking of companies, right now, a handful of American, Chinese, Japanese and European companies are ruling the video game market. Sizeable investments have come in from the Middle-East, but beyond being financiers, they currently do not have a creative presence in the industry. The good thing about this market is that it remains open for anyone to come in with a portfolio of bestselling games, and gain the trust and respect of the audience. In the future, we could possibly see a handful of companies rise from countries that had no previous industry presence, and surprise the market with a slew of good games.

There has been a growing demand for games that go beyond entertainment, and that will help bring about some social change. We certainly have a handful of such games already present in the market, but they are yet to gain mainstream appeal. As more people continue playing and making games, it is likely that a few developers will take up the challenge of making the first successful game for social change.  

There is indeed a lot of potential for this medium to impact the world at large, but it is currently stuck in a self-created rut of focusing on monetisation rather than innovation. If and when the industry is able to pull itself out of that rut, there can be some hope for video games to have a more useful impact on the world. 

## Platforms

This part is a bit tricky to predict. Ten years ago, it was easy to assume that the market would continue getting more powerful hardware every few years, resulting in new consoles, PCs and mobiles on a regular basis.

In 2024, we are at a point where the hardware is indeed getting more powerful, but also pricier. Sony recently announced that their mid-generation refresh of the *PlayStation 5* console will cost $699 in the US, and even more in other regions, making the *PlayStation 5 Pro* the most expensive home console ever. This doesn’t bode well for the next generation of home consoles.

Sony’s main competitor, Microsoft, is yet to announce a mid-generation refresh, and there are rumours swirling within the industry that Microsoft may eventually leave the home console business, focusing entirely on being a game publisher instead. This is yet to be verified, but there are indeed some signs that point that way. Microsoft has competed with Sony across three console generations, and has always finished in second, or even third place, with Nintendo giving a tough fight to both its rivals. 

As such, it may not make business sense for Microsoft to keep investing billions of dollars in researching and producing consoles, which are almost always sold at a loss, when it can instead focus on improving the PC gaming market, where it owns the dominant platform, Windows. 

So, we may be looking at a future where Microsoft exits the console race entirely, leaving only Sony and Nintendo as survivors. Since Nintendo has perfected its strategy of not competing on raw power and instead focusing on exclusive experiences, it will not be in direct competition with Sony. That would result in the two console manufacturers each having a monopoly over their respective sub-markets, which isn’t a good thing for consumers.

Going further into the future, we might eventually reach a point where home consoles become obsolete altogether. The promise of cloud-based gaming has been teased for years, and we do have a handful of functioning cloud-gaming services right now. However, we are yet to witness the success of a true end-to-end cloud service. The only glimpse we had of such a service was Google’s short-lived *Stadia*, which had a strong technological backbone, but suffered from poor management. 

However, there are other challenges to running a successful cloud-gaming service, namely the availability of high-quality Internet services across the world, and the control of these services. Right now, many governments hold the power to control the Internet usage in their respective countries. It would require a lot of effort to convince gamers to invest in a cloud-based gaming service, knowing that their access could be cut off with little notice from their governments. 

When it does work though, the promise of cloud-gaming is certainly exciting. The ability to choose any device and be able to play any kind of game on it, without having to worry about the hardware configuration or software updates, sounds really good. The current version of cloud-gaming services we do have, like *GeForce Now, Xbox Cloud Gaming*, and *Luna* are very limited in their offering, and are only available in a few countries.  There’s certainly a long road to travel before cloud-gaming becomes a genuine alternative to PC/Console gaming.

Moving on the last major platform, let us talk about mobiles. Gaming has always been a bullet point in the list of things that a mobile phone can do. Watching Apple’s carefully produced showcases introducing their new iPhones, it becomes clear that gaming is currently an afterthought for smartphone manufacturers. There are a few Android phones that are designed specifically for gaming, but we are yet to see Apple or Google themselves design a phone that is entirely designed for playing games.

Part of the reason is that some of the most popular mobile games on the market do not really require very powerful hardware. They are specifically designed to run on low-end devices, so they rarely use the full potential of some of the most powerful phones available today. So it’s safe to say that mobile phones do not really require more powerful hardware for the gaming market to grow.

What’s required in this segment is wider availability. There are still untapped markets in the world where people do not own phones powerful enough to play video games. When interest and demand for gaming and other entertainment services grows in these markets, it is likely that mobile phones will offer the lowest barrier of entry in these price sensitive market. In other words, the mobile gaming market is only set to grow even larger, which will no doubt annoy a lot of PC/Console enthusiasts.

## Reality

This section is sort of a continuation to the previous one, because we are still discussing platforms. However, this next platform deserves a section of its own, because of the sheer amount of time and money that has been poured into trying to  stabilise it. 

*Virtual/Augmented Reality* (VR/AR) devices have been trying to break into the video market for nearly two decades now. Companies like Sony, Microsoft, Samsung, Valve, HTC, Facebook/Meta, Google, and Apple have all tried to make their presence felt in this market, with varying degrees of success. What’s common with all their efforts is that VR/AR as a segment is yet to find mainstream appeal in the gaming market. 

Facebook/Meta admittedly has had the most success, with their *Meta Quest* lineup of headsets selling hundreds of millions of devices over the past decade.  The company has infamously poured in billions of dollars every year into their *Reality Labs* division, which is yet to produce a product that will help the VR/AR segment become mainstream. The company’s goal is to be the first to build a successful *metaverse*, a virtual world which users would enter using a VR headset, and interact with one another as they would in the real world.

Part of this company’s challenge is to convince users that they can offer a safe and secure solution that won’t infringe on users’ privacy. Facebook/Meta continues to generate billions of dollars in revenue each quarter thanks to the advertisement business run across its multiple social media services, so the company can afford to fund its ambitious *metaverse* experiment for a few more years.

The latest significant entrant to the VR/AR market is Apple’s *Vision Pro* headset, which was offered as a premium product priced at $3500, and promptly failed to make an impact. That product leans more towards the AR side of things and is not a dedicated gaming device, so the market will have to wait and watch in which direction Apple will take  this concept forward. 

Sci-fi writers have on multiple occasions envisioned a future in which people would strap on a headset onto their face and disappear into a virtual world. While such a concept is indeed a reality today, many people have discovered that they do not like the idea too much. 

Playing a game inside a virtual reality environment might feel extremely immersive, but most humans do not like the idea of being cut off from the real world entirely. This phenomenon usually activates our survival instincts and we get anxious or nervous. This is why a lot of people do not like using these headsets for an extended period of time. That is one of the main challenges that these device manufacturers need to solve before this segment is able to become mainstream.

## Competition

This part of the chapter, talking about the future of eSports, will be a bit difficult for me to write, owing to my limited knowledge about this area of video games. However, as someone who maintains a casual interest in all aspects of the industry, I can come up with a couple of decent guesses.

The future of any sport depends on its audience. You could be the most talented athlete on the planet for a particular sport, but if that sport does not attract a sizeable audience, it is unlikely for you to make a decent living as a professional sportsperson.

The same theory applies to the domain of eSports. At the moment, things seem to be going well, with several eSports organisations successfully running professional tournaments across the world, and audience numbers at venues going up.

At the same time, things are not going as well as they could, with one notable instance being the  professional organisation,*Overwatch League*, shutting down after operating for over seven years.

The issue is always going to be audience interest. The numbers are certainly growing, but not nearly fast enough to offset the rising costs of conducting these tournaments every year. 

As for the games themselves, one can certainly expect to see some innovations in how these tournaments are broadcast, and how fans can engage and follow their favourite athletes.

Speaking of athletes, there is certainly no dearth of people wanting to become professional esports athletes. Over the coming years, we can expect to see a more formal, guided path laid out for amateurs to turn pro, which will help in establishing esports as a stable career option. 


## Business

The entertainment industry at large finds itself in a constant battle between the artists and the executives. Things are no different in the world of video games, where a lot of seemingly bad decisions made for otherwise decent games, can almost always be traced back to the the executives.

This battle is bound to continue into the future as well, and we can expect to see some interesting results. The key issue between the two parties is usually monetisation. 

At the moment, there are largely two kinds of monetisation in the video game market: *Free-to-Play* (F2P), and *Premium*. The former is a tried and tested model that has been embraced by the mobile game market, while it is relatively newer for the PC/Console market, where premium games still bring in a lot of revenue.

Going forward, the F2P model is likely to lead the next big expansion of the market, attracting newer players and convincing older players to return. The reason for this is that the existing lineup of F2P titles has given players enough reason to expect high-quality games without paying an upfront price. If they end up liking the games they play, some of them are happy to pay for the microtransactions in them. The others are satisfied with whatever content they get for free.

As a result, developers of premium games, which ask players for an upfront purchase to access the games, are finding it more difficult to convince the market to try their products. Even games that may receive excellent reviews from the critics might struggle to find a large paying audience beyond the most dedicated fans of each console platform. 

One possible solution that has been suggested by a few analysts, is for developers of premium games to reduce their scope, and produce shorter games, that will be cheaper to develop, and sell. Convincing players to pay $70 for a AAA game that offers 20+ hours of content may be difficult going forward. However, selling a smaller game that offers around 10 hours of content, featuring the same level of production values as a AAA game, and a price tag of $30 of less, *might* be easier.  

Early evidence of this theory lies in the success of games like *Palworld* and *Manor Lords*, which are not full-blown AAA experiences, but feature high-fidelity graphics, and a price tag of $29.99 and $39.99 respectively. Both games have sold millions of copies on the basis of their unique gameplay elements, and interestingly enough, both games are still in early access as of September 2024.

If following the F2P or Premium models is not feasible for developers, the only other option is to embrace the subscription model. At the moment, the market offers various subscription services to users, who pay a fixed monthly fee and access all the games in those services’ catalogues. Developers usually get paid a fixed fee upfront to have their games included in these catalogues, and may receive additional benefits based on their contracts. While this may not be a feasible solution for larger studios, it is ideal for smaller studios, who wish to make games targeted at a niche audience.

However, the financial viability of subscription models is currently a bit shaky, and is one of the things to watch out for in the future. 

If there’s one prediction that is very safe to make about the business side of things, it is the impending death of the physical sales of game discs. The industry has been steadily shifting from sales of physical discs in favour of digital sales, and apart from a small group of fans who wish to continue supporting physical sales, the audience at large has found it more convenient to make purchases digitally. It might not be long before publishers find it financially unfeasible to continue printing discs, and might cease their production entirely. 

To wrap up this section, I would personally welcome any future development that will shake up the business side of things, because the situation right now is really unstable. Consumers are unhappy with the predatory monetisation tactics, developers are unhappy with the constant threat of losing their jobs, and I suppose the executives are also unhappy about how much more difficult it is becoming to survive in this industry. It’s about time for a change.
