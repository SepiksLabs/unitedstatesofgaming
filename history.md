# History
This chapter attempts to summarise the key moments in the history of video games. It should in no way be considered to be exhaustive, because the history of video games has so many fine details that it deserves to be explored in its entirety, rather than as a single chapter of a book.

In fact, author Steven L.Kent has explored this subject in great detail, in *The Ultimate History of Video Games*, a collection of two books together spanning more than 1200 pages. 

What I will go over in this chapter will be the key moments in the history of video games that have led us to the present day, where this industry is significantly larger than other entertainment industries.

I pondered about the ideal method to categorise the various periods of video game history. The obvious method seemed to use the home console generations, which cover the essential moments pretty well, starting with the first generation in 1972, leading up to the ninth generation, which is currently ongoing.

However, the definition of these generations is a bit blurry and can quickly get confusing. For instance, the Nintendo Switch console, which launched in 2017, is considered by some to be part of the eight generation of consoles, while others feel it marks the start of the ninth generation. Also, these *generations* span across multiple decades, and I found it to be a bit jarring to keep going back and forth in time while discussing them.

Other possible methods to classify video game history include breaking it down by industry and technological milestones, or highlighting the impact of certain key players, such as Atari, Nintendo and Sega in the early days. All these methods run the risk of missing out on discussing certain other aspects of video game history.

Thus, in an attempt to cover as much ground as possible, I have opted to classify the time periods using decades. The modern video game industry formally started in 1972, and each decade since then has seen various technological and cultural evolutions which have helped shape the industry into the behmoth that it is today. 

Before we dive headfirst into modern video game history however, we need to spend some time talking about how it all started.

## The Dawn of Time - 1971
We humans pride on ourselves being the dominant species of this planet, but at our core, we aren’t so different from the rest of the living population. Every day, we work towards fulfilling the most important task of the day: have a nourishing meal, preferably multiple times during the day, and then we try to figure out what to do with ourselves until it is time to sleep. 

Within this seemingly simple routine, one can trace the earliest origins of video games.  Let’s put the *video* part aside for now, and look at how the concept of *games* evolved through the ages.  While we do not have video archives of the sort of games our ancestors used to play, numerous illustrations from various countries depict people engaging in all sorts of leisurely activities, including some of the earliest board games, and sports. Eventually, some genius invented the dice, opening the doors to the earliest forms of gambling. 

Even in these early days, one could see the concept of games being used for different reasons. It is here that we can guess that the concept of *games* split into three branches. The first branch consisted of simple *Games* that would be played for the sake of entertainment. The second branch was *Gambling*, which lured you in with the promise of earning money. The third branch made up numerous *Sports*, which were a means to test your skills against your peers and were a matter of pride. 

Gambling has long had an uneasy relationship with *games*, but it is undeniable that the two of them grew up together.  In fact, “gaming” is still used as a term to describe legalised gambling in some countries across the world today, even though the term has since been taken over by the video game industry on a wider scale. 

The growth of sports can be attributed to organised events such as the Olympics, which were first held in Greence in the year 776 BC. The *Anicent Olympics*, as they are referred to, became an important milestone in the evolution of organised sports, later leading to the *Modern Olympics* and numerous other sporting events.

That leaves us with *games* that were played just for fun. This seemingly harmless branch would eventually grow into the modern behemoth that we now know as video games, but there’s still quite a bit of history to cover before we reach that seminal year of 1972.

If you were not gambling or pursuing a serious sport, the concept of games in the early days simply meant that you were looking for ways to pass the time when you were not at work. It didn’t take long for businesses to realise that consumers would pay them good money for products that would make it easy to pass the time. 

In 1889, Japanese entrepreneur Fusajiro Yamauchi started a company to manufacture playing cards. There are conflicting sources as to what Yamauchi named his company. One source says it was initially called *Marufuku*, while another says it was named *Yamauchi Fusajirō Shōten*. There is a third version of the name which may be immediately familiar to modern audiences. It was *Yamauchi Nintendo*.

We will get back to Nintendo’s story in due course of time, but Yamauchi’s early efforts were only one of many in the growing entertainment or *amusement* industry, which saw various attempts to introduce novelties for which consumers would be willing to pay money.

These attempts gave rise to the category of games known as *Arcade Games*. Most of these games were coin-operated, and were designed to be *easy to learn, but hard to master*. This design principle would ensure that players would have to keep paying up for multiple games, until they either ran out of money or lost interest. 

Games like Skee-ball, Pinball, and various electro-mechanical games helped the Arcade game category grow throughout the early 20th century, indicating a strong demand from the market for these amusement products. The fact that we dealt with two World Wars during the same time suggested that people had already started using games as a coping mechanism, to escape from the grim reality around them. 

It is probably poetic that it was a wartime physicist who is also credited with developing one of the earliest known examples of a game that you could view on an electronic display, or a *video game*. 

In 1958, William Higinbotham, who was a physicist and part of the team that built the first nuclear bomb, built an interactive electronic game called *Tennis for Two*, that is considered to be one of the first true *video* games. There were some other releases before this that used graphical displays to provide interactive entertainment, but *Tennis for Two* is the most well-known of all those early games.

However, this wasn’t what one would consider a commercial video game. In fact, it was merely created as part of an exhibition event at Brookhaven National Laboratory, to be used as a display to entertain visitors. William Higinbotham had no intention to improve on his creation and make more games; it was something that he and his colleagues put together in a few weeks in their spare time.

This would go on to be a recurring theme among scientists and engineers. Whenever they came across some new technological advancement, some of them would immediately try to use the new technology to make games, not with the intention to sell them, but for fun.

The next prominent example of this came in 1961, in the form of *Spacewar!*, a space combat game developed by a group of programmers led by Steve Russell, Martin Graetz and Wayne Wiitanen for the DEC PDP-1 minicomputer installed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The community of programmers back then was quite small, and they frequently shared their work with each other, which led to *Spacewar!* being credited as “possibly the first game to be played on multiple computer installations”, which meant it was one of the earliest (if not the first) video games to be distributed to multiple users instead of being part of an exhibition or showcase on a single device.

However, the PDP-1 minicomputer, which was required for *Spacewar!* to run, was incredibly expensive. In fact, it was so expensive that only 53 units were ever shipped. Naturally, it wasn’t exactly an ideal platform for developing video games.

This was the problem that a lot of smart people tried to solve throughout the 1960s. Everyone knew that electronic games were the next big thing, but no one had figured out a cheap way to bring the technology to the masses.  Towards the end of the decade, a company called *Magnavox* started development on the first home video game console.

As the days went by and the calendar changed to 1970, another company called *Syzygy Engineering* began work on what would become the first arcade video game to be released: *Computer Space*. Designed by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, the game released towards the end of 1971 and was met with modest success.

1971 was the final year in which *electronic games* would be seen as technological novelties, only targeted at a small group of geeks who were in interested in computers. Various companies were now preparing to deliver products that would help define the nascent video game market, and introduce the medium to a wider audience. 

All these efforts came together in 1972, and our journey through the history of video games is going to get a whole lot more exciting. 

## 1972 - 1979

If all the events leading up to 1972 helped shape the ideas of what early video games would look like, the rest of the 70s shaped these ideas into a formal industry. This decade even featured the first documented use of the term *video game*, which was reportedly mentioned in a *BusinessWeek* article in 1973.

1972 was a huge year for video games. First, it saw the release of the Odyssey, the first home video game console developed by Magnavox.  While it may seem rudimentary by today’s standards, it was nothing short of a marvel in those days. It didn’t feature any fancy graphics. All it did was render a few dots and one line in varying forms. Then the user had to place plastic sheets onto their TV representing various “games”, such as Table Tennis, Hockey and Football, and the console would render the dots differently based on the selected game. The dots would be controlled using two controllers, which looked nothing like the modern controllers of today. The Odyssey was a decent success for its time, selling around 350,000 units during its lifecycle.

The second highlight for 1972 was the release of the hit Arcade game, *Pong*, created by a team led by Nolan Bushnell, who disbanded his previous company to form a new outfit called *Atari*.  In an example of history repeating itself, *Pong* was strikingly similar to *Tennis For Two*, in that it was a game similar to Table Tennis, and was designed to be played by two players. 

*Pong* was created by legendary designer Allan Alcorn, who initially made it as a “training exercise” to get used to the process of making games. Since this was an Arcade game, users couldn’t purchase it directly from Atari. Instead, it was retailers who purchased the machines from Atari, and then charged users $0.25 for each play session. 

Visiting an arcade to play video games soon became a favourite pastime for an entire generation, and it wasn’t long before the old pinball machines were replaced by video game cabinets.

While the Magnavox Odyssey did not have nearly the same financial impact as Pong, its cultural impact is universally recognized. Subsequent console releases from Magnavox failed to establish it in the nascent video game market, especially with Atari turning into a powerhouse in the 1970s.

While arcade games continued to bring in money for Atari, the company realized that the business model was not sustainable in the long-term. Arcade cabinets were bulky and costly to produce, not to mention the fact that they could only play one game at a time. Eventually there was an option to swap out the circuit board so that a new game could be played using the same machine, but it was still not a practical option for the long-term. Atari realised that the home console business pioneered by Magnavox was the way to go.

In 1977, Atari came up with its own home console, called the *Atari Video Computer System* (Atari VCS), later re-branded as the *Atari 2600*. It used a swappable cartridge system, in which users had to invest in a console once, and play new games by swapping out cartridges instead of buying a new machine.

The cartridge system was first brought to market by another console called the *Channel F*, developed by Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation. It came out in 1976, but even with their early mover advantage, they could not establish themselves in the market.

The Atari VCS on the other hand, managed to survive the initial threat of slow sales, and went on to become the market leader, selling more than a million units by 1979.

The success of the VCS was largely due to the selection of high-quality games available for the machine. Atari licensed popular arcade games such as Space Invaders to be available on the VCS, and customers loved not having to go to the arcade to play their favourite games.

The end of the decade saw Nolan Bushnell leave Atari, but not before the company had established itself as the first true success story in the fledgling video game industry.

Atari was also one of the first few companies that showed the potential of software sales bringing in millions of dollars in revenue, something that was unheard of back then.

As soon as money enters the picture, any industry is susceptible to greed. And that’s exactly what happened in the next chapter of the story.
