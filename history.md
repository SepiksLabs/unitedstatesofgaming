# History
This chapter attempts to summarise the key moments in the history of video games. It should in no way be considered to be exhaustive, because the history of video games has so many fine details that it deserves to be explored in its entirety, rather than as a single chapter of a book.

In fact, author Steven L.Kent has explored this subject in great detail, in *The Ultimate History of Video Games*, a collection of two books together spanning more than 1200 pages. 

What I will go over in this chapter will be the key moments in the history of video games that have led us to the present day, where this industry is significantly larger than other entertainment industries.

I pondered about the ideal method to categorise the various periods of video game history. The obvious method seemed to use the home console generations, which cover the essential moments pretty well, starting with the first generation in 1972, leading up to the ninth generation, which is currently ongoing.

However, the definition of these generations is a bit blurry and can quickly get confusing. For instance, the Nintendo Switch console, which launched in 2017, is considered by some to be part of the eight generation of consoles, while others feel it marks the start of the ninth generation. Also, these *generations* span across multiple decades, and I found it to be a bit jarring to keep going back and forth in time while discussing them.

Other possible methods to classify video game history include breaking it down by industry and technological milestones, or highlighting the impact of certain key players, such as Atari, Nintendo and Sega in the early days. All these methods run the risk of missing out on discussing certain other aspects of video game history.

Thus, in an attempt to cover as much ground as possible, I have opted to classify the time periods using decades. The modern video game industry formally started in 1972, and each decade since then has seen various technological and cultural evolutions which have helped shape the industry into the behmoth that it is today. 

Before we dive headfirst into modern video game history however, we need to spend some time talking about how it all started.

## The Dawn of Time - 1971
We humans pride on ourselves being the dominant species of this planet, but at our core, we aren’t so different from the rest of the living population. Every day, we work towards fulfilling the most important task of the day: have a nourishing meal, preferably multiple times during the day, and then we try to figure out what to do with ourselves until it is time to sleep. 

Within this seemingly simple routine, one can trace the earliest origins of video games.  Let’s put the *video* part aside for now, and look at how the concept of *games* evolved through the ages.  While we do not have video archives of the sort of games our ancestors used to play, numerous illustrations from various countries depict people engaging in all sorts of leisurely activities, including some of the earliest board games, and sports. Eventually, some genius invented the dice, opening the doors to the earliest forms of gambling. 

Even in these early days, one could see the concept of games being used for different reasons. It is here that we can guess that the concept of *games* split into three branches. The first branch consisted of simple *Games* that would be played for the sake of entertainment. The second branch was *Gambling*, which lured you in with the promise of earning money. The third branch made up numerous *Sports*, which were a means to test your skills against your peers and were a matter of pride. 

Gambling has long had an uneasy relationship with *games*, but it is undeniable that the two of them grew up together.  In fact, “gaming” is still used as a term to describe legalised gambling in some countries across the world today, even though the term has since been taken over by the video game industry on a wider scale. 

The growth of sports can be attributed to organised events such as the Olympics, which were first held in Greence in the year 776 BC. The *Anicent Olympics*, as they are referred to, became an important milestone in the evolution of organised sports, later leading to the *Modern Olympics* and numerous other sporting events.

That leaves us with *games* that were played just for fun. This seemingly harmless branch would eventually grow into the modern behemoth that we now know as video games, but there’s still quite a bit of history to cover before we reach that seminal year of 1972.

If you were not gambling or pursuing a serious sport, the concept of games in the early days simply meant that you were looking for ways to pass the time when you were not at work. It didn’t take long for businesses to realise that consumers would pay them good money for products that would make it easy to pass the time. 

In 1889, Japanese entrepreneur Fusajiro Yamauchi started a company to manufacture playing cards. There are conflicting sources as to what Yamauchi named his company. One source says it was initially called *Marufuku*, while another says it was named *Yamauchi Fusajirō Shōten*. There is a third version of the name which may be immediately familiar to modern audiences. It was *Yamauchi Nintendo*.

We will get back to Nintendo’s story in due course of time, but Yamauchi’s early efforts were only one of many in the growing entertainment or *amusement* industry, which saw various attempts to introduce novelties for which consumers would be willing to pay money.

These attempts gave rise to the category of games known as *Arcade Games*. Most of these games were coin-operated, and were designed to be *easy to learn, but hard to master*. This design principle would ensure that players would have to keep paying up for multiple games, until they either ran out of money or lost interest. 

Games like Skee-ball, Pinball, and various electro-mechanical games helped the Arcade game category grow throughout the early 20th century, indicating a strong demand from the market for these amusement products. The fact that we dealt with two World Wars during the same time suggested that people had already started using games as a coping mechanism, to escape from the grim reality around them. 

It is probably poetic that it was a wartime physicist who is also credited with developing one of the earliest known examples of a game that you could view on an electronic display, or a *video game*. 

In 1958, William Higinbotham, who was a physicist and part of the team that built the first nuclear bomb, built an interactive electronic game called *Tennis for Two*, that is considered to be one of the first true *video* games. There were some other releases before this that used graphical displays to provide interactive entertainment, but *Tennis for Two* is the most well-known of all those early games.

However, this wasn’t what one would consider a commercial video game. In fact, it was merely created as part of an exhibition event at Brookhaven National Laboratory, to be used as a display to entertain visitors. William Higinbotham had no intention to improve on his creation and make more games; it was something that he and his colleagues put together in a few weeks in their spare time.

This would go on to be a recurring theme among scientists and engineers. Whenever they came across some new technological advancement, some of them would immediately try to use the new technology to make games, not with the intention to sell them, but for fun.

The next prominent example of this came in 1961, in the form of *Spacewar!*, a space combat game developed by a group of programmers led by Steve Russell, Martin Graetz and Wayne Wiitanen for the DEC PDP-1 minicomputer installed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The community of programmers back then was quite small, and they frequently shared their work with each other, which led to *Spacewar!* being credited as “possibly the first game to be played on multiple computer installations”, which meant it was one of the earliest (if not the first) video games to be distributed to multiple users instead of being part of an exhibition or showcase on a single device.

However, the PDP-1 minicomputer, which was required for *Spacewar!* to run, was incredibly expensive. In fact, it was so expensive that only 53 units were ever shipped. Naturally, it wasn’t exactly an ideal platform for developing video games.

This was the problem that a lot of smart people tried to solve throughout the 1960s. Everyone knew that electronic games were the next big thing, but no one had figured out a cheap way to bring the technology to the masses.  Towards the end of the decade, a company called *Magnavox* started development on the first home video game console.

As the days went by and the calendar changed to 1970, another company called *Syzygy Engineering* began work on what would become the first arcade video game to be released: *Computer Space*. Designed by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, the game released towards the end of 1971 and was met with modest success.

1971 was the final year in which *electronic games* would be seen as technological novelties, only targeted at a small group of geeks who were in interested in computers. Various companies were now preparing to deliver products that would help define the nascent video game market, and introduce the medium to a wider audience. 

All these efforts came together in 1972, and our journey through the history of video games is going to get a whole lot more exciting. 

## 1972 - 1979

If all the events leading up to 1972 helped shape the ideas of what early video games would look like, the rest of the 70s shaped these ideas into a formal industry. This decade even featured the first documented use of the term *video game*, which was reportedly mentioned in a *BusinessWeek* article in 1973.

While this decade was certainly dominated by arcade games, it also laid the foundation for home consoles, which would go on to play a key part in the revival of the industry.

Let’s walk through some of the important moments of this decade, starting with the release of the first home console, the *Magnavox Odyssey*. Designed by Ralph Baer and in development for several years, it was formally launched in 1972 and attracted the attention of a curious market. This first console was not a breakout hit by any means, selling just over 350,000 units over its lifetime. However, the first of anything is noteworthy, and the *Odyssey* will thus be remembered for being the first commercial video game console.

While it may seem rudimentary by today’s standards, the *Odyssey* was nothing short of a marvel in those days. It didn’t feature any fancy graphics. All it did was render a few dots and one line in varying forms. Then the user had to place plastic sheets onto their TV representing various “games”, such as Table Tennis, Hockey and Football, and the console would render the dots differently based on the selected game. The dots would be controlled using two controllers, which looked nothing like the modern controllers of today. But hey, everyone has to start somewhere.

1972 is also notable for the founding of *Atari, Inc.*, by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney.  Bushnell and his team had followed the development of the *Odyssey*, but were more focused on the coin-operated arcade market. 

In November 1972, Atari officially released *Pong*, the first commercial arcade game. It was originally created as a training exercise by legendary designer Allan Alcorn, who, just like most people at the time, was new to the concept of developing video games.  In a curious case of history repeating itself, *Pong* was strikingly similar to the concept of *Tennis For Two*. It was a game loosely based on Table Tennis, and was designed for two players. The first player to reach a score of 11 would win the game. 

The simplicity and familiarity of *Pong* helped it become an instant hit. Since this was an arcade game, players couldn’t purchase the game directly from Atari. Instead, Atari would sell the machines to business owners, who would then place the machines in public spaces and charge $0.25 for each session. 

However, Atari realised the limitations of this business model. There was clearly a lot of interest in the market for games, but by restricting themselves to selling arcade machines, Atari could not reach out to a large part of the audience. They were limited by how many machines they could manufacture and sell to businesses. 

The solution to this problem was already present in the market: release a home console, which was a much cheaper machine to manufacture, and something that customers could take home.

By 1975, Atari felt confident enough to enter the nascent home console market, and released their first home console, which was  essentially a miniature arcade machine. It could only play one game, *Pong*, but at least customers didn’t have to go to the arcade to play anymore.  This single-game home console idea wouldn’t last long, but it was successful enough to establish the feasibility of selling products in the home console market. 

Other companies would also enter this interesting market space throughout the decade. While we won’t look at all of them in detail, one console in particular is worth mentioning for an important innovation it brought to the market. The *Fairchild Channel F* console was released in 1976, and it was the first home console to feature swappable cartridges. 

Until this point, games were always built into the console system. The *Odyssey* required users to put up different screens on their TV to play different games, while systems like *Pong* only allowed you to play a single game. With swappable cartridges, users had to buy the console once, and then play new games by purchasing new cartridges, which were much cheaper than buying an entirely new system.

This idea, pioneered by an engineer named Jerry Lawson, would go on to be the de facto standard for all major home consoles until the 1990s. 

Unsurprisingly, Atari, which remained the market leader at the time, jumped onto the cartridge system concept and included it in their next home console release, the *Atari Video Computer System*, which came out in 1977. This console would later be renamed as the *Atari 2600*, and become the key reason why the video game market’s grew by leaps and bounds in the 70s.

Atari became the most successful video game company in the market, and was one of the pioneers of the “Startup culture” as we know it today. In 1976, to help fund the launch of the VCS, Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications for a princely sum of $28 million, which would be worth around $154 million in 2024 after adjusting for inflation. 

It was only during the late 70s that Atari began to face some serious competition from the market. But to understand that, we need to go back a bit and start the story of this decade again, this time from the perspective of an entirely different market.

Let’s go back once again, to 1972. Remember Mr.Yamauchi’s playing-card company, Nintendo? By 1972, it had evolved into a toy company, and was actively looking into entering the electronic gaming market.  Their first efforts gave rise to a partnership with both, Magnavox and Atari, and Nintendo distributed the *Odyssey* and *Pong* in the Japanese market in 1972 and 1974 respectively.

By 1975, Nintendo began making its own arcade games, and while none of these early efforts were hits, they provided a lot of valuable experience. 

In 1977, in the same year that Atari launched the VCS,  Nintendo released its first home-console, dubbed the *Color TV-Game*. Unlike Atari though, Nintendo was still using the old, in-built storage system, so there were several of these *TV-Game* systems.

Nintendo was still finding its footing in the market, but another company, *Taito*, would take the crown for releasing the first Japanese game to find overseas success. In 1978, Taito released an arcade game called *Space Invaders*, which tasked players to fight aliens dropping from the sky. 

The cultural impact of *Space Invaders* was huge. It was likely the first true blockbuster of the video game market. Imagine playing a seemingly simple game like *Pong*, and then moving to a high-action game like *Space Invaders*, which could actually get stressful as the game went on. It was unlike anything players had seen before. Reports indicated that there was a shortage of coins in Japan due to demand for operating the game’s machines. 

In 1979, Atari came up with their own space-themed blockbuster game, called *Asteroids*. Featuring a new visual style called “vector graphics”, its gameplay was a bit more complex and engaging than *Space Invaders*. Both games had their own dedicated fanbases, and continued to perform well in the market. 

And thus we come to the close of the first decade of video game history. It was an era of experimentation, and laid the foundation for many of the principles upon which the industry operates even today. 

Before we wrap up this section, it is worth mentioning three more key events that took during this decade.

The first was that Nintendo made an important hire in 1977, a designer by the name of Shigeru Miyamoto. He would initially work on some of the *Color-TV Game* systems, but his major contributions would only surface in the 1980s.

The second was the formation of *Activision, Inc.* in 1979. Formed by a group of former Atari programmers, Activision would go on to become the first third-party developer for the Atari 2600 console, and continues to be a major name in the video game market today.

The third was the exit of Nolan Bushnell from Atari. While  Atari under Bushnell didn’t exactly have the best reputation for maintaining a good workplace, his absence would definitely leave a hole that Atari would struggle to fill, eventually leading to the company’s downfall in the following years.

## 1980 - 1989
The 1980s began with a bang. Very early into the decade, the world saw the release of some of the most iconic games ever made, like *Pac-Man* and *Donkey Kong*. Older arcade hits like *Space Invaders* began appearing on home consoles, and Atari allowed third-party developers like Activision to make games for the 2600, giving consumers a wider choice of games.

However, the first half of the decade would also spell doom for the video game market, threatening the stability of the entire industry and encouraging some analysts to predict that the video game “fad” was done and dusted.

However, the doom and gloom was limited to the North American market, and in another part of the world, Japanese companies kept pretty busy this entire decade, bringing several memorable games and consoles that ended up stabilising the American market as well.

That’s a lot to unpack, so let’s start from the beginning, with the release of *Pac-Man* in 1980. The origin story of everyone’s dot-gobbling machine is quite fascinating. The game’s creator, Toru Iwatani was eating out one day, and had ordered pizza. When the meal arrived, Iwatani picked up one slice of the pie, and when he looked down at the rest of the pizza, the design of *Pac-Man* with his mouth open suddenly flashed in his head. 

Soon after that, Iwatani’s employer, Namco released the first version of *Pac-Man* into arcades. With its colourful design and playful music, *Pac-Man* attracted new audiences into arcades, especially those who were put off by all the violent games that were previously available. *Pac-Man* became the first video game icon, with his face plastered onto merchandise, appearing in a TV show and several other games. *Pac-Man* also holds a world record for being the most successful coin-operated game of all time.

While Taito and Namco had already claimed major success in the Japanese and global markets, their much older peer, Nintendo, was still waiting for its first true hit.

Nintendo was keeping busy in the console market by releasing the *Game & Watch* series of devices, starting in 1980. As the name implies, these devices functioned as both, a game console, and a watch. These devices were considered to be the first major success for Nintendo in the video game market, and also the first successful handheld gaming device.

This was well and good, but Nintendo still wanted to break into the lucrative arcade business, so they kept trying to release games that would attract the attention of the global market. 

The company finally struck gold in 1981, with *Donkey Kong*, designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. The game featured a hero called “Jumpman”, who had to jump through various obstacles to free his girlfriend, who was taken captive by a gorilla named “Donkey Kong”. The simple objective, put together with interesting gameplay mechanics, helped *Donkey Kong* become a worldwide hit, and marked the first time that a video game with a simple narrative appealed to audiences. 

Meanwhile, back in the American market, Atari may have fallen behind in the arcade scene, but was still going strong, releasing numerous hits for its 2600 console. Several more arcade hits were ported over to the 2600 console, and with third-party developers contributing as well, it was not a stretch to say that the market was flooded with games of varying quality. 

Then in 1982, Atari released a movie tie-in game for *E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial*. The story behind the development and release of this game are worth its own chapter, but briefly put, it was developed in a very short period of time and rushed to market in order to meet the deadline of a Christmas release. This affected the quality of the game severely, and it was a commercial flop.

Years later, some analysts would remark that the game wasn’t all that bad, but it definitely lacked the polish that customers expected from an Atari game back in the day. 

Regardless, the failure of *E.T.* was so devastating that Atari ended up burying a huge pile of unsold copies in a landfill.

We now move to the year of 1983, which is best known in the pages of history for the crash of the North American video game market.  There are a few things to consider while discussing this crash.

First, the formal video game market had only been in existence for 11 years at this point, and the games themselves were very much targeted at children. Parents had little to no idea of what kind of games and/or consoles to purchase, but what they knew was that these *toys* were expensive.  Playing a game at an arcade might cost $0.25 per session, but  a console would cost $150 upfront, while each individual game could go up to $30 in the early 80s. 

Second, the failure of *E.T.* and the flood of low-quality games from third-party developers meant that it was not a great time to buy video games in 1983. 

Third, the crash largely affected the home console market. Arcades were still going strong, because children still went out with their friends, and adults visited bars and restaurants too.

And finally, the crash only affected the North American market, which, arguably, was and still is, the largest market worldwide. However, since global markets were a lot more isolated back then, the crash did not significantly affect other markets, notably Japan, which continued to innovate and thrive. 

In America however, it seemed like the video game dream was truly over. Companies started to go bankrupt, even Atari. The first truly successful game company would soon become a shell of itself, being sold to different parties over the years. New console releases became rare, and the industry survived on the support of the arcades, as well as the newly growing PC gaming scene.

Back in Japan, safe from the ramifications of the American market, Nintendo was going full steam ahead. In July 1983, the company released its next home console system, the *Famicom*, which stood for “Family Computer”.  It used a cartridge system, and released with games that were proven arcade hits. The Famicom got off to a slow start in Japan, and it would not be until late 1984 that the console became a true success.

By now, enough time had passed for companies to start trying to revive the American market. The sentiment was that parents were still overly cautious about purchasing any “video games”, so Nintendo realised they needed a good marketing campaign to sell their console in the American market.

To aid the marketing campaign, the team also made some significant changes to the console itself. First, they renamed it as the *Nintendo Entertainment System* (NES). Then, they redesigned the exterior of the console to look less like a game console and more like a standard Video Cassette Recorder (VCR). Further, they added two accessories to the package to help them position the device as a true “entertainment system” rather than a game console.

These changes helped Nintendo gain a foothold into the sensitive console market. However, the true catalyst for the device’s success would be its games. And luckily for Nintendo,  in 1985, Mr.Miyamoto returned with something special. 

Jumpman, the protagonist of the arcade hit *Donkey Kong* got a new name and a new game in 1983, called *Mario Bros.* This arcade game got a sequel called *Super Mario Bros.* in 1985, and it became a system seller for the newly re-branded NES console. Miyamoto followed up this successful release with another iconic title, *The Legend of Zelda*, in 1986. Unlike *Mario*, which was a platformer game, *Zelda* was an action-adventure game, which encouraged exploration in a fantasy land. In the same year,  there was *Metroid*, which combined both, platforming and exploration.

The NES soon became known as the place to play exclusive blockbuster hits not available anywhere else. Nintendo was also careful not to repeat the mistakes made by Atari, and did not allow third-party developers directly onto their platform. Instead, developers had to obtain a license from Nintendo, who would strictly approve games that met their high standards. The *Nintendo Seal of Quality* became an important factor to build trust among audiences for Nintendo’s games.

As time crept into the second half of the 80s, the worldwide gaming markets began to recover, with fewer console releases and better quality games allowing consumers to make more informed choices. Gaming once again began to grow as a hobby, although still largely limited to a younger audience. The children who had grown up in the 70s playing the early games were now hungry for something more mature and engaging.

These young adults found the PC gaming scene to be more to their liking. However, unlike the console market, the PC market was more unorganised and fragmented. There were numerous PC platforms to choose from, with devices ranging from the *Commodore 64, Apple II, IBM PC* and so on. 

Early PC gamers were mostly enthusiasts, who built and shared games among themselves. In the 80s, the PC market started to mature, and commerical PC games became more viable. 

Text-based games were very popular during this era, as they placed a lot of emphasis on the story and narrative aspects of the game rather than gameplay. On a related note, Role-playing Games, or RPGs, began to evolve on the PC platform as well.

One notable company to rise in the PC market during this decade was *Sierra On-Line*, which helped pioneer the growth of the adventure genre through its *King’s Quest* series of games.

Other noteworthy PC games to come out during this decade include *Rogue (1980)*, which laid the foundation for the “rogue-like” genre of games, *Ultima (1981)*, a pioneer for RPGs, *Microsoft Flight Simulator (1982)*, one of the earliest simulation games, *Elite (1984)*, a space trading and simulation game, *Prince of Persia (1989)*, an iconic action platformer, and *SimCity (1989)*, a city-building simulator.

This era is also known for introducing online multiplayer functionality and the shareware distribution model, two concepts which would find wider adoption in the next decade.

For now, let us return to the console market, where, by 1987, Nintendo had established itself as the worldwide leader.  The NES was a cultural phenomenon, and it wasn’t long before the competitors started getting restless. 

Service Games of Japan, later renamed as Sega Corporation, had been active since the 1960s. Being a Japanese company with American roots, Sega was keen to replicate the success of Nintendo in both, the Japanese and American markets. 

Following the path set by Nintendo, Sega first released a home console system in the Japanese market, called the *Sega Mega Drive*. Released in 1988, the console was more powerful than the NES, but it lacked the bestselling games that Nintendo seemed to put out every single year. Sega released the console in the American market by re-branding it as the *Sega Genesis*, and the company’s best achievement for the decade would be that it became a recognised rival to the NES.

Meanwhile, Nintendo returned to its handheld console roots by releasing the *Game Boy* console in 1989. Its portable form factor, coupled with the successful bundling of *Tetris*, a 1984 hit game developed by Russian developer Alexey Pajitnov, delivered another category-defining hit for Nintendo. 

By the end of 1989, Nintendo was the undisputed leader of the home console and handheld console markets, the PC gaming scene was evolving with unique and innovative games attracting a mature audience, and the world was preparing itself for the arrival of the Internet, which had already been in a kind of beta test throughout the 80s.

Thus, we move to the next chapter of the story, with video games firmly establishing themselves as a powerhouse in the entertainment industry.

## 1990 - 1999
Until now, we have explored the history of video games in a vacuum, completely cut off from the rest of the world. That’s because that was how the world largely functioned until the end of the 80s, with different industries rarely affecting each other.

However, the 90s marked the start of the Internet Era. Various technological advancements started affecting multiple industries at the same time, and one of the biggest beneficiaries was the video game industry. 

Few people could have predicted that Nintendo and Sega, the top dogs in the console market at the start of 1990, would become almost irrelevant by the end of the decade, or that Sony, a company with no previous history in the industry, would become the new king of the console market. 

Let’s unpack this busy decade, which saw the rise and fall of multiple companies, and prepared the world for a new millennium of gaming.  

Our story resumes in 1991, by which time Sega executed its master plan to dethrone Nintendo in the console market. This plan has been documented in several books and media, the most well-known of which is perhaps the book, *Console Wars.* The plan largely involved appealing to a more mature audience, but also to come up with an original mascot for Sega, to compete with Nintendo’s iconic mascot, Mario. 

The fruits of this plan resulted in the 1991 smash hit, *Sonic the Hedgehog.* It was a platformer similar to the *Mario* games, but Sonic was fast, very fast. The powerful hardware of the *Genesis* allowed Sega to turn Sonic into a speed machine, and the children who grew up playing Mario were immediately attracted by the more mature tones of Sonic. 

Bolstered by Sonic’s success, as well as a smart collection of games such as *Streets of Rage (1991)*, and *John Madden Football ‘92 (1991)*, Sega briefly rose to the top of the home console market.

However, Nintendo wasn’t going to sit around doing nothing. The company released the successor to the NES, titled the *Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)*/*Super Famicom* between 1990-1991 in the Japanese and American markets. It featured a more powerful hardware configuration that would help it compete with Sega’s *Genesis* system. 

The SNES depended on Nintendo’s rich back catalog of characters to deliver numerous bestselling titles. These included *Super Mario World (1990)*, *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (1991)*, *Super Metroid (1994)*, and *Donkey Kong Country (1994)*.

Naturally, it didn’t take long for Nintendo to reclaim its crown from Sega. Analysts identified that Sega’s in-fighting among its US and Japanese executives was also a key reason for the company losing focus on their strategy, and eventually losing the “console wars” to Nintendo. 

That said, the console wars were important to keep both companies in check and proved to be a boon for consumers, who could enjoy a wide variety of games that only helped grow the appeal of the hobby. 

The Internet era is said to have started on August 6, 1991, when a computer scientist named Tim Berners-Lee launched the form of the Internet we now know as the “World Wide Web”. The world’s first “website” went live on that day, and it didn’t take long for various “online” services to start cropping up.

While the true power of the Internet was yet to be unleashed in the world of video games, the floodgates were now open, and developers began to communicate with one other all over the world. This facilitated the easy transfer of knowledge and tools, encouraging more tech-savvy youngsters to take up full-time careers in software development.

Naturally, some of these developers were more attracted towards developing video game software, and went on to start companies that are considered pillars of the industry today. Some examples include *Blizzard (1991), Bungie (1991), id Software (1991), Epic Games (1991), Insomniac Games (1994), BioWare (1995), Remedy Entertainment (1995), Valve Corporation (1996),* and *Rockstar Games (1998)*. 

Some companies which had been established in the 80s also started gaining more prominence in the 90s. These include *Activision, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft,* and *Naughty Dog.*   

Suffice to say, there were quite a lot of incredible game launches in this decade, across the PC and console markets. This trend would continue for the foreseeable future too. So, to avoid this story from turning into a list of noteworthy games, I have made a list of noteworthy games in the *Appendices* section.

To recap our journey through the 90s so far, the home console market continued to grow under the leadership of Nintendo and Sony, while the PC market saw some exciting new companies bring out innovative games that started to define many new genres for the first time.

Let us now move forward to the year 1994. The home console market was due for a refresh, and all eyes were on two exciting technologies.

The first was a brand new storage technology called *Compact Discs* (CDs). CDs not only offered significantly more storage space, but they were also much cheaper to mass-produce compared to cartridges. 

The second was the even more exciting realm of 3D gaming. Up until that point, 3D gaming had appeared in very few titles, restricted by the hardware available. But with better processing power, and the efficiency offered by CDs, 3D gaming was widely expected to take center stage. 

Several parties tried to make the combination of 3D gaming with CDs work, but the first product to hit the market was from a company that no one expected: *Sony*. 

Sony was not the first company with a non-gaming background eager to enter the market. They were sensible enough to know that they needed an experienced partner to help them gain foothold into the lucrative gaming market. So, they partnered with Nintendo to develop what was originally a CD-drive add-on for the SNES. 

However, due to some complications, the partnership fell apart, and Sony was left with an interesting piece of technology that showed great promise. So they took a leap, and introduced the world to the first *PlayStation* console in 1994.

Continuing the trend started by Sega, the *PlayStation* was targeted at mature audiences, which made a lot of sense. Imagine you were a 10-year old kid in 1977, who played on the Atari 2600. By 1994, when the *PlayStation* came out, you would have been a 27-year old adult. Games targeted at children would likely not interest you as much anymore. 

Identifying this need for more mature titles, Sony enlisted a group of third-party developers to publish a wide range of games that would appeal to an older audience, all of them presented in 3D.  It didn’t take long for the *PlayStation* to become the new leader of the home console market.

To their credit, Nintendo and Sega both tried to compete and had varying degrees of success, but neither of them could match Sony’s wide success.

Nintendo’s answer to the *PlayStation* was the *Nintendo 64 (N64)*, which came out in 1996. It had 3D capabilities, but it stuck to the old cartridge system of storing games, which severely limited the scope of its titles. The N64 was still considered to be a success, with titles like *Super Mario 64 (2996)* and *GoldenEye 007 (1997)* becoming huge hits. However, the library of games available for the N64 was tiny compared to the *PlayStation*, and Nintendo couldn’t keep up in terms of sales. 

However, Nintendo continued to perform well in the handheld market, where it was still at the top. The *Game Boy Color* came out in 1998 and sold quite well, boosted in part by sales of a popular game franchise called *Pokémon*.

On the other hand, Sega’s answer to the *PlayStation* was the *Saturn*, which released too early, at a higher price, and offered limited 3D capabilities. It paled in comparison with the *PlayStation* and effectively lost the race in that console generation. 

Sadly, Sega’s next console release in 1998 ran into similar problems, where it had an early launch, and thus could not compete in terms of hardware capabilities with the other players in the market. This console, the *Dreamcast*, would be Sega’s final attempt at participating in the console wars, and it would eventually bow out of the hardware business.

Wrapping up the home console side of this story, the decade ended with Sony’s *PlayStation* at the top, and the company teasing a much more powerful successor to be released at the start of the next decade. Nintendo was still in the race, but was barely surviving with the N64.

Over in the PC market, things were getting a lot more interesting, with the rising popularity of online multiplayer games. *First-person Shooters* (FPS) such as *Doom*, *Quake*, *Half-Life* and *Unreal Tournament* would go on to establish the PC platform as the best place to play games of this genre.

At the same time, other genres like *Real-Time Strategy, Adventure, Simulation*, and *RPGs* began to grow on the PC as well, making the PC platform a viable alternative to  traditional consoles as a gaming platform. 

The wider penetration of Internet services allowed for a new genre to evolve, called MMOs. These were *Massively Multiplayer Online* games, which allowed hundreds, or even thousands of people to play on the same server, at the same time. It was a gaming experience like no other, and players were hooked. Early MMOs like *Ultima Online (1997)* and *EverQuest (1999)* laid the foundation for this genre, whose potential would be revealed in the following decade. 

If all this excitement were not enough, the 90s also laid the foundation for an entirely new platform on which video games could be played. Mobile phones, which were still quite large and bulky, but were starting to be used to offer simple games.

The most famous mobile game of this era had to undoubtedly be *Snake*, released by Nokia on its 6110 handset in 1998, which offered an addictive gameplay loop, which could be played in small bursts during the day. By the late 90s, a few phone manufacturers started including pre-installed games which varied a lot in quality. But these games were the early attempts at turning mobile phones into gaming devices, which is reminiscent of the early attempts to create video games in the 60s. Unlike the PC/Console market however, the mobile gaming market would not require decades to reach its true potential.   

As the rest of the world braced itself for Y2K, the world of video games looked forward to another decade filled with technological advancements, and of course, more exciting games to play.

## 2000 - 2009
In any industry, the flow of money usually drives companies to enter or exit the consumer markets. The same holds true for the video game industry as well. In the 70s, once Magnavox and Atari in particular, proved that there was money to be made in video games, a number of companies, including Nintendo and Sega, were suddenly keen to enter the market.

This trend would continue in the 80s and 90s as well, with companies that had no previous experience with video games enter the industry, eager to make a dent and cash in on the demand for more games and consoles. 

In the 2000s however, the industry started seeing companies enter the industry almost by accident, and as a byproduct of their presence in other markets. The three major examples of this phenomenon were *Facebook, Google*, and *Apple*. All of them became major players in the video game market almost unintentionally, because their software platforms played host to some of the largest user populations across the world.

The results of these companies’ actions would not be entirely  visible until the next decade, but it was in the early 2000s that their foundations were laid. We will get to these in time, but for now let us get back to our story.

The year was 2000, and the market was ready for a new batch of video game consoles. The one that was most eagerly awaited was the *Sony PlayStation 2 (PS2)*, which, as of September 2024, is the console with the most number of units sold, at 155 million. The PS2 launched across the world at various dates during 2000, and immediately became an instant hit.

Featuring more powerful hardware than its predecessor, the PS2 also added the capability to play DVDs, and later added network support, allowing select games to offer online multiplayer functionality. 

The first competitor to the PS2 arrived in September 2001, in the form of the *Nintendo GameCube*. It once again ignored conventional discs and opted to  use Nintendo’s own proprietary optical discs. While this allowed the console to offer higher-quality games than the N64, it once again paled in comparison to the market leader, the PS2. To be fair, the console sold a decent number of units - over 21 million - across its six year lifespan, but compared to the 155 million racked up by the PS2, it was clear that Nintendo could not compete at the same level. 

Behind the scenes, another competitor was getting ready to step up to the challenge of dethroning the PS2. Keeping up with the tradition of non-gaming companies entering the market, Microsoft, who until then, was a traditional software developer, decided to introduce the Xbox console into the market.

To differentiate their console from the PS2, Microsoft added a few new features. For instance, the Xbox would be the first console to feature a built-in hard drive. Also, online functionality would be designed as a core feature for the console, rather than the add-on nature of the PS2.  To support this principle, Microsoft released a dedicated network called *Xbox Live* in 2002, which was designed to deliver online services to Xbox players. 

To ensure a successful launch for the console, Microsoft looked for “system sellers”, i.e., exclusive games that were compelling enough to entice players to buy the console. This search resulted in Microsoft acquiring *Bungie, Inc.*, which was getting ready to launch its FPS game, *Halo: Combat Evolved*.

The Xbox console launched in November 2001, along with *Halo: CE*, and had a successful launch. After the demise of Atari, this was the first major console designed by an American company, and the market was excited. *Halo* would later get a sequel that only solidified the franchise’s status as a system seller, and over its lifespan of roughly five years, the Xbox managed to sell 24 million units. Xbox was not able to compete with the PS2 in sales, but it proved itself as a worthy competitor. 

The next major console release didn’t happen until 2005, so let us spend some time in the PC market. 

By the year 2000, PC hardware became more accessible, enabling the common public to buy more powerful components that were capable of playing the latest video games. Unlike consoles, whose hardware was frozen until the next console upgrade came out several years later, PCs could be upgraded as soon as a new part was available in the market. 

This flexibility made the PC a more appealing platform to enthusiasts, who wanted to play with the latest and most powerful hardware at all times. However, the PC platform was not necessarily favoured by most developers, due to two major problems, which were related: distribution, and piracy.

The shareware distribution model worked wonders for the PC market in the 90s. However, the widespread availability of broadband Internet in the 2000s meant that it became easy for people to share digital content with one another. This led to the digital media being pirated, a problem that had become apparent in the 90s, but which grew to gigantic proportions in the 2000s. This affected video games as well, because users could simply copy the contents of a game disc, and then spread it over the Internet, leading to lost revenue for the developers and publishers. 

Besides, distributing games on discs was not always ideal, especially for developers of smaller games, who could not afford the cost of printing discs and selling them at retail stores. There was a rising demand in the developer community for a solution that would combat both these issues, preferably at the same time.

Enter Valve Corporation. Founded in 1996 by former Microsoft employees, Valve was best known as the developer of the breakout hit, *Half-Life*. When preparing to launch the sequel, Valve wanted a better method to distribute its game, and also provide updates to its players. In 2003, the company came up with *Steam*, a service that handles the distribution and maintenance of digital games. 

Initially, Steam was only used to manage games developed by Valve, but later, it was converted into a full-service marketplace, which any individual or company could use to publish their games. Steam provided a basic protection against piracy by requiring users to own a license for each game. While this did not eradicate piracy at large, it at least provided a basic level of security, for which developers were grateful. Steam turned into a massively successful marketplace, so much so that Valve paused its game development projects for several years and focused on growing the Steam platform. Today, it is the market leader for PC gaming, attracting millions of users everyday. Valve is also the largest distributor of PC games, taking a 30% revenue share from most games sold on its Steam platform. 

If Steam was not proof enough that digital gaming was on the rise, *Blizzard Entertainment* gave the world further evidence of this phenomenon. In 2004, Blizzard launched their MMORPG, titled *World of Warcraft (WoW)*. Based on the popular *Warcraft* franchise that Blizzard had spent building during the 90s, WoW offered a unique online gaming experience like no other. The game went on to redefine the MMO genre, and twenty years later, it continues to thrive, attracting millions of players willingly paying a monthly subscription price just to access the game. 

2004 also saw the launch of *Facebook*, a fledgling social media website, but we’ll return to it later in the story.

Then came the year 2005, which means it’s time to return to the console market. Four years after the launch of the first Xbox, which came out a whole year after the PS2, Microsoft decided to try to get an early advantage over Sony in the next generation of home consoles.

By now it was an open secret that the next lineup of consoles would feature High-Definition (HD) graphics, a feature that players were eagerly looking forward to. Microsoft was the first one to deliver on this promise, with the launch of the *Xbox 360* in November 2005. 

Unfortunately, the first batch of consoles suffered from a phenomenon nicknamed the *Red Ring of Death*, which indicated that the console was “dead” and required to be serviced. 

However, when it worked, the console offered a great gaming experience. Moreover, the games on offer were great as well. Microsoft’s first-party lineup included hits like *Gears of War, Halo 3*, and *Fable II*. The online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, received an upgrade as well, and offered an improved user experience. 

When it was Sony’s turn to reveal its HD console, the company confidently presented the *PlayStation 3 (PS3)*. It was certainly a more powerful console than the PS2, and promised to deliver a superior HD gaming experience. The only caveat was the price. The PS3 was introduced to the market at a price of $499 for the base model. In comparison, the Xbox 360 launched at a price of $299 for the base model. Fans were furious, and the PS3 struggled in sales at launch.

At first, it seemed like Microsoft had won. The Xbox 360 had better software, a better price, and could play all the third-party developed games as the PS3. Sure, the failure rate of the Xbox 360 was worrying, but that could be fixed. What else could stop Microsoft from claiming victory?

The answer, as it turned out, was Nintendo. 

Nintendo’s last attempt at releasing a home console was the *GameCube* in 2001, which could not compete with the PS2 or Xbox in terms of raw power. In fact, the company realised that it would become increasingly difficult to keep up with Sony on technical advancements alone. So, in an attempt to differentiate itself in the market, Nintendo started working on a different kind of game console.

In 2006, that console launched almost simultaneously with the PS3. This new console was called the *Wii*. It did not offer HD gaming capabilities, and it had nowhere near the same raw power as the other major consoles. However, it featured a single, powerful gimmick: motion-controlled gaming.

Up until that point, games had only been played using bulky controllers, while sitting down. No matter what action happened in the game, the player would always be sitting in the same position, pushing some buttons on the controller.

The *Wii* changed all of that. Motion-controlled gaming meant that the player could now stand up and move around, with their in-game avatars mimicking their actions. For instance, while playing a game of tennis, the players could swing their arm as if they would swing a racquet, and their in-game character would swing their in-game racquet accordingly. 

This gimmick soon turned into a worldwide hit, and over its lifecycle, the *Wii* sold more than 101 million units. Its success is widely attributed to the fact that it introduced new audiences to gaming, thanks to its simple control scheme. Playing an Xbox or PS3 game involved learning which buttong to push at the right time. Playing a *Wii* game mostly involved picking up the remote and moving it around. 

This surprise entrant to the console market disrupted the plans of both Sony and Microsoft, who then rushed to bring their own motion-controlled devices to the market, but they would only start appearing in markets in 2010.

As the market adjusted itself to the success of the *Wii*, there was another disruption waiting to happen in the wings.

But since we’ve just discussed the chaos caused by *Wii*, let us take a breather and go back a bit to talk about the handheld gaming market, which saw quite some action in this decade. 

Nintendo was already at the top of the handheld market with the hugely successful *Game Boy* and *Game Boy Color* lineup. They followed these up with *Game Boy Advance* in 2001, which was essentially a more powerful variant of the older consoles, and it was received remarkably well.

However, Nintendo had a surprise for the handheld market, and it was just as disruptive as the *Wii* was for the home console market. In 2004, the world was introduced to the *Nintendo DS*, where the DS stands for “Dual Screen”. As the name suggests, the console featured two screens, including a touch interface, which made for a really unique handheld gaming experience. The DS proved to be so successful that it eventually went on to sell 154 million units, becoming Nintendo’s most successful console release of any kind.

2004 also saw a new entrant to the handheld market, in the form of Sony’s first handheld product, the *PlayStation Portable* (PSP). While it was arguably more powerful than the Nintendo DS and offered better looking games, it was only able to sell around 80 million units in its lifetime.

As a reminder, the PS2 outsold the N64 in the home console market. In a curious turn of events, it was now Nintendo’s turn to claim victory over Sony in the handheld market. Of course, after the release of the *Wii*, Nintendo would claim victory in the home console market as well.

Now let us turn our attention to the other big disruption of the decade. The year was 2007. On January 9, a former employee of Atari named Steve Jobs appeared in front of an audience, and introduced the world to a “revolutionary” device called the *iPhone.* He claimed that it was good at three things: being a phone, a music player with touch controls, and an Internet navigator. What he didn’t mention, or probably didn’t know yet, was that he had just unveiled the first version of what would become the world’s largest gaming platform. 

Later that year, in May, the small social media website we mentioned earlier, Facebook, announced that it was introducing the *Facebook Application Developer Platform*. In other words, it was inviting third-party developers to make apps for users of Facebook, of which there were more than 25 million at that point. 

The ramifications of these two events would be felt in the video game market by the end of the decade.

In 2008, Apple unleashed the App Store, allowing developers to make apps for the iPhone platform. In the same year, Google unveiled its own mobile platform, the *Android Market*. Suddenly, developers had two new platforms with which they could reach mobile users.

To add some context, up until this point, the mobile gaming market was very unorganised, and largely dependent on the mobile manufacturers. 

Mobile games had certainly evolved from their early *Snake* roots, thanks to the introduction of Java-based games. However, the lack of a unified storefront meant that your mobile gaming experience varied depending on the kind of mobile you purchased. The screen sizes were usually quite small, and the input was limited, due to the plastic keypads/keyboards of the early mobile phones.

But with the iPhone, developers had access to a unified storefront, and a device featuring a large touchscreen, allowing for customised controls. Google’s Android platform was largely inspired by the iPhone, meaning Android devices offered similar features.

By 2009, the world saw its first major mobile game hit, in the form of *Angry Birds*. Back then, it was a premium game, meaning you had to purchase the game outright to play it. The notion of free games on mobile phones was present, but had not yet become the norm.

As the decade drew to a close, Facebook made its presence felt in the video game market. Similar to Apple and Google, Facebook never actually made the games themselves, but merely provided the platform for third-party developers to publish their games. Facebook saw its first global hit in the form of *Farmville*, which came out in 2009, the same year as *Angry Birds*. Unlike the latter, *Farmville* was a free-to-play game, and it popularised the concept of *social gaming*, wherein players used Facebook’s social networking features to invite their friends to play together. It was similar to multiplayer gaming, but with the added layer of a social media website. 

Since this decade has run out of years, we will pick up this story in the next section. To recap though, this decade started in a conventional way, with Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo releasing home consoles like usual. But it ended in a completely unexpected way, with mobile gaming on the rise, and companies alien to the gaming landscape slowly becoming major players in the industry.

Little did we know back then that the story was only going to get weirder.

## 2010 - 2019
It seems funny to think about this today, but many of the market leaders started the new decade fearing that the days of the traditional video games were numbered.

Mobile games were rising in popularity rapidly, and were much cheaper and faster to produce. Titles like *Clash of Clans* and *Candy Crush Saga* began drawing in millions of dollars, without featuring lifelike graphics or a gripping narrative that was usually expected from blockbuster games.

Analysts outside the industry began to predict that mobile phones would soon make consoles redundant, and they were partially right. But we’ll get to that shortly.

In 2010, despite the fears of rising competition from the mobile market, Sony and Microsoft were busy catching up to the motion-control challenge set by Nintendo. It was finally time to unveil what they were working on to compete with the *Wii*.

Sony came up with *PlayStation Move*, which was similar to the *Wii*, except that it featured two controllers instead of one remote.

Microsoft came up with a more innovative spin on the concept, called the *Kinect* which eliminated the need for controllers/remotes altogether. Instead, the user would stand in front of a camera, which would detect their motion and translate it to the game. This was arguably a more intuitive way to play games, but by the time the device was released, the Wii had already established itself as the leader in this sub-category of the market.

Both solutions were received with lukewarm response, with critics agreeing that they were innovative, but they failed to capture the market’s attention in the same way that the *Wii* did. 

By the time the PS3 and Xbox 360 consoles reached the end of their lifecycles, they failed to catch-up to the *Wii* in terms of sales, and Nintendo finished on top of the sales charts.

Before moving on to the next generation of consoles, there is one other trend about the previous generation that needs to be discussed. Around 2010, it became easier for independent developers, or *indies*, to publish their games on consoles and on PC via Steam. This gave birth to the Indie gaming revolution, where small-scale games could suddenly sell hundreds of thousands or even millions of copies. Early examples of this trend include *Braid, Super Meat Boy, Minecraft, Fez,* and many others. As a result, traditional game developers and publishers had to deal with the competition from a whole new set of developers, most of whom could operate on minuscule budgets, and bring their products to the market rapidly.

Now let us turn our attention to the next generation of home consoles, beginning with Nintendo’s successor to the *Wii*. Rather than follow up on the successful formula established by the *Wii*, Nintendo decided to go in another direction with their next console. The *Wii U* was launched in November 2012, and it finally caught up to the other consoles by offering HD graphics. Sadly, the rest of the feature set didn’t appeal to the general audience. Once again, there was a unique controller, this time in the form of a large handheld tablet with its own screen. The console was backward comatible with the *Wii* collection of games and peripherals. However, there was no further innovation in the motion-control department. The *Wii U* had a poor sales record, selling only 13.5 million units, as compared to the *Wii’s* 101.6 million. Nintendo discontinued the *Wii U* in early 2017.

Meanwhile, Sony and Microsoft were preparing for the release of their next consoles. For the first time, the rivals would be launching their consoles in the same month - November 2013, setting up the market for an exciting competition. 

If the previous generation had seen Sony lose momentum during the launch window due to a high retail price, this time it was Microsoft’s turn to set themselves up for failure. Their next console was announced to be the *Xbox One*, and it was positioned as an all-in-one entertainment system. 

The initial pitch for the console was that it would forcefully be paired with a new Kinect sensor, and a bevy of features were announced that were all focused around using the console as an entertainment system. Gamers felt left out and confused. 

To make things worse, it was initially announced that physical copies of games could not directly be shared between users, and that the console would have an always-online requirement to function smoothly. Although this feature was later walked back, the PR damage was done. The final nail in the coffin was the initial retail price of $499, and the console was doomed to fail even before it launched.

On the other hand, Sony came up with a much simpler pitch. Their new console would predictably be called the *PlayStation 4* (PS4), would cost $399 at launch, and would not make any changes to how physical games were shared. As an added bonus, analysts later revealed that the technical specs of the PS4 were slightly better than the *Xbox One*.

As November 2013 came along, to no one’s surprise, the PS3 began leading in sales. Microsoft tried to do some damage control by unbundling the Kinect sensor, which would drop their console price down to $399, the same as the PS4. However, it was too late. The audience had decided that  their choice would be the PS4, and it would go on to outsell the Xbox One by more than two to one.  

Microsoft would eventually respond by shifting its focus from hardware sales to a new subscription service called *Xbox Game Pass*, which soon attracted the attention of millions of users. However, it was not enough to convince people to give up their PS4s entirely, with the PS4 still continuing to outsell its rival every single year.

Outside the battle between the two console giants, analysts noticed something interesting. A lot of them had feared that consumers would no longer buy consoles, and would instead play games exclusively on mobile phones and PCs. However, this theory was quickly proven wrong. 

What happened instead is that we witnessed the emergence of an entirely separate video game market, one which wrote its own rules as it kept growing exponentially. This was the mobile game market, which soon became the most valuable gaming platform in terms of number of players as well as the revenue earned. 

When news broke that a mobile game called *Flappy Bird* which was made by a solo developer was earning a revenue of $50,000 per day, an entirely new market segment was created overnight, called *Hypercasual Games*. Companies raced each other to come up with a formula to make games that could be developed rapidly and generate the most amount of money through ads and in-app purchases. 

Eventually, there was less thought about making the games fun for the players, and more about what was the most efficient way to generate revenue. This resulted in hypercasual games being intentionally designed with short, addictive gameplay loops, and stuffed with ads at every opportunity. Worse, the main method to acquire users for these games were through ads placed on social media apps. These ads were often misleading, not presenting an accurate experience of playing the game. 

Since social media apps were growing in popularity throughout the decade, mobile games kept growing in popularity as well, bringing in billions of dollars to the mobile market as a whole. This trend would continue well until the end of the decade.

Now let’s talk a bit about the other major segment of the industry - the PC market. In the 2010s, PCs had firmly established themselves as the best place to play high-end games. None of the home consoles that launched during this decade could match the high-end PCs, which only kept getting better each year, while the consoles’ hardware could not be upgraded until the next product cycle.

This meant that PCs became the exclusive destination to find some of the most played games on the market. These included titles like *Counter Strike, League of Legends, DoTA 2,* and of course, MMOs such as *World of Warcraft.*

PCs also became the platform of choice for the growing esports scene. It became viable for talented players to turn playing competitive games into a career, with tournaments like *The International* offering millions of dollars in prizes.

Next, let’s spend some time with the handheld market. With mobile phones dominating the portable gaming scene, there was little reason for users to purchase dedicated handheld gaming devices anymore. This didn’t mean that there was no longer any market for these, but even Nintendo could not repeat the success of its DS console in this decade.

The notable handheld consoles that put up a fight during this decade were the *Nintendo 3DS*, which offered a unique 3D display which didn’t require any glasses, and the *PlayStation Vita*, which didn’t perform as well as the PSP. 

With the lukewarm reception to the 3DS and the *Wii U*, Nintendo realised that it was time once again to try something new, and went back to the drawing board. It re-emerged in 2017 with yet another surprise.

The *Nintendo Switch* is a hybrid between a handheld and a home console, which looks like an unholy mixture of all of Nintendo’s previous ideas. It features motion-control remotes like the *Wii*, a large gamepad like the *Wii U*, and the portability of all of its handheld devices. The *switch* feature allows users to place it in a dock and play their games on a large display, like any other home console. The only drawback is that it is not as strong as the other consoles on the market.

I had to switch to present tense because the *Switch* continues to sell consistently in 2024, with a successor planned for release sometime in 2025. 

When it first came out in 2017, the *Switch* attracted the market’s attention like the *Wii* did during its launch. Players were happy to compromise on raw performance and instead get portability and flexibility in how they played. It’s a bit difficult to compare the sales figures of this console with its peers, because it has competed with two generations of *PlayStation* and *Xbox* consoles. As of September 2024, it has sold over 143.4 million units, which is remarkable. 

To summarise what’s happened so far, we have seen the launch of two traditional home consoles, two handheld devices, and one hybrid console. On top of that, we had the numerous mobile phone upgrades, all of which bolstered the mobile game market.

What else could possibly happen in this hectic decade? As it turned out, two more things.

The rise of the mobile market proved that traditional console makers could not be complacent anymore. It was time to look forward to the future and be ready for change that was inevitable. 

In line with this thought, we saw the introduction of *Virtual Reality* (VR)/*Augmented Reality* (AR) devices, as well as cloud-based gaming services during this decade. 

More about these two devices/services will be discussed in the chapter talking about the future of gaming, but for the sake of our story, this decade saw the introduction of devices like the *Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR, HTC Vive, PlayStation VR* and *HoloLens* on the AR/VR side. 

Meanwhile, Google made a grand entry into the cloud gaming market with a brand new platform called *Stadia* in 2019. We will discuss about this morsel of history in the next section. 

To wrap up this decade, it is important to point to the continued importance of the Internet and the role it played in growing the video game market. The streaming service *Twitch* launched in 2011 and would forever change how people consumed video game content. YouTube would play its part in popularising gaming culture as well, with several  YouTubers playing a crucial role in the marketing of some well-known games. 

In 2019, it felt like a great time to pursue video games, both, as a hobby and a career. As the calender rolled over to the next year, we would learn that video games had become such an important part of human culture that even the most terrible of circumstances only made the industry stronger. 


## 2020 - 2024

Should this section even be included in this chapter? Technically, events that took place even yesterday can be considered to be history, but it does feel a bit strange to talk about something that happened in 2020. 

That’s partly because it was such a scary period of time in human history, and partly because it feels like it happened very recently. Nonetheless, we have a story to complete, and this most recent section of video game history does have quite a bit of action.

This section has been kept intentionally brief, because a lot of the recent events and trends that occurred during this period have been discussed in greater detail in other chapters.

We’ll begin with 2020. The first year of COVID-19. A terrible year in the chapter of human history, but it turned out to be one of the most profitable years for the video game industry. It’s similar to how certain industries profit during wars. In 2020, while the world waged a war against COVID, video game companies soon discovered that more people were playing more video games when they were isolating themselves indoors.

That’s not to say it was all good news for the industry. The pandemic caused a global semiconductor crisis, as well as disrupted global logistics. These factors severely impacted the launch of the new generation of home consoles, which launched simultaneously in  November 2020.

From Sony came the bulky *PlayStation 5* (PS5), which earned the dubious honour of being the largest home console ever made. It promised high-fidelity gaming along with smoother performance. The console came along with a new controller called *DualSense*, which was packed with innovative features, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

From Microsoft came the “most powerful console ever made”, the *Xbox Series X* (XSX). However, Microsoft shot themselves in the foot yet again, by also releasing a weaker version called the *Xbox Series S* (XSS). While the XSS helped Microsoft offer a lower-priced model, it was also the weakest of all three consoles, once again providing Sony a greater advantage. The XSX was more powerful, sure, but it sold far less than the XSS.

It didn’t take long for the market to realise that Microsoft had lost the battle in the launch month itself. While fans clamoured to buy the new PS5, demand for the XSX/XSS was relatively lower. As a result, Microsoft kept improving its *Game Pass* offering, by acquiring several reputed studios and adding their games to its first-party catalogue. The acquisiton of *Activision Blizzard King* for $68.7 billion was the largest bet Microsoft ever made, and it remains to be seen how much benefit will be generated by this deal. 

Meanwhile, Nintendo is yet to release a successor to the *Switch*, but the old hybrid console continues to perform well in the market, having turned itself into a lucrative platform for Indie developers.

On the PC side of things, things were a bit slow at the start of the decade, once again, due to the semiconductor crisis, but also due to the surge in demand for GPUs created by a sudden interest in cryptocurrency mining. Things have stabilised to a great extent in 2024, and the PC market continues to be at the cutting edge of gaming performance.

Moving on to the mobile market, people got wise to the fact that hypercasual games are annoying, and demand for them has started to decline, but still continues to exist to some extent. Publishers are now moving to a new genre dubbed, *hybrid-casual* games, which are a new take on the formula, offering more in-depth gameplay mechanics, while still stuffing in as many advertisements as possible. 

One silver lining in the mobile market is the rising popularity of more serious, or complex games such as *Genshin Impact* and *Zenless Zone Zero*, which require players to pay attention to what they’re doing. These games are still designed to extract money, this time in the form of a gambling mechanic known as *gacha*, but it seems we are still quite far from being rid of predatory monetisation practices in the mobile market. 

Continuing the trend of companies that previously had nothing to do with games enter the market, video streaming giant *Netflix* has now become part of the industry. The company has acquired a few development studios, and is maintaining a curated collection of games to play on its mobile app. 

Remember Stadia, the cloud gaming service launched by Google? Well, that didn’t last long. It was shuttered in 2023 after Google failed to generate interest among users to sign up for the service, and before they could even release a high-quality game that could truly take advantage of Google’s cloud-powered technology. 

Handheld gaming sort of made a comeback, in the form of the success enjoyed by devices like the *Valve Steam Deck* and *Asus ROG Ally*. Targeted towards PC gamers interested to take their library along with them on the road, these devices proved that there is still considerable interest in the handheld market, provided the right device comes along.

Apart from these assorted events that took place, we also saw the rise and fall of several trends, including User Generated Content (UGC), Blockchain/NFT-based games, and of course, AI-powered games. 

Although we are halfway through the decade, personally it doesn’t feel like we have seen anything significant happen so far. Sure, we have seen many new devices come out, some really great games to play, but they all seem like incremental upgrades, and hardly the huge innovations that previous decades have given us.

That may be partially due to the current mood in the industry, which is pretty glum. Once the world forgot about COVID and got back to work, the general interest in gaming also witnessed a sharp fall,  meaning that companies couldn’t  suddenly didn’t know what to do with all the excess staff they had hired to keep up with the demand during COVID.

This resulted in more than 30,000 jobs being lost across the industry in the years between 2022 - 2024 (ongoing). This rapid shift in workforce numbers had a greater effect on how companies operated, resulting in a “play-it-safe” attitude from the largest players. 

Analysts believe this downward trend could end, or at least start improving as soon as 2025, and if history has taught us anything, it’s that what goes down will eventually come up. Few people believed that the industry would recover from the crash of ‘83. And yet, it did.

So, it is only a matter of time before we see an uptick in the fortunes of the industry, and we can hope for some positive changes to take place in the next few years.

That concludes the story of the video game industry…so far. The past 52 years have been quite fascinating, full of highs and lows, and at the end of it all, a massive industry that continues to entertain and motivate billions of people everyday. 

With an industry of this size, there are bound to be some bad apples. And some of those apples are so huge that they give the other apples a bad name. But looking at the bigger picture, I am optimistic that we will get out of this current rut, where everyone’s focus seems to be on monetisation, and move on to the next phase of this wonderful art form.
