# History
This chapter attempts to summarise the key moments in the history of video games. However, it should in no way be considered to be exhaustive, because the history of video games has so many fine details that it deserves to be explored in its entirety, rather than as a single chapter of a single book.
What I will go over in this chapter will be the key moments in the history of video games that have led us to the present day, where this industry is significantly larger than other entertainment industries.
I pondered about the ideal method to categorise the various periods of video game history. The obvious method seemed to use the home console generations, which cover the essential periods pretty well, starting with the first generation in 1972, leading up to the ninth generation, which is currently ongoing.
However, the definition of these generations is a bit blurry and can quickly get confusing. For instance, the Nintendo Switch console, which launched in 2017, is considered by some to be part of the eight generation of consoles, while others feel it marks the start of the ninth generation. Also, these *generations* span across multiple decades, and I found it to be a bit annoying to keep going back and forth in time while discussing them.
Other possible methods to classify video game history include breaking it down by industry and technological milestones, or highlighting the impact of certain key players, such as Atari, Nintendo and SEGA in the early days. All these methods run the risk of missing out on discussing certain other aspects of video game history.
Thus, in an attempt to cover as much ground as possible, I have opted to classify the time periods using decades. The modern video game industry formally started in 1972, and each decade since then has seen various technological and cultural evolutions which have helped shape the industry into the behmoth that it is today. 
Before we dive headfirst into modern video game history however, we need to spend some time talking about how it all started.
