# Culture

Culture (/ˈkʌltʃə/) *noun*

*the ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a particular people or society.*

For most of humankind’s history, cultural evolutions were slow and a bit predictable. However, human culture has been kind of hard to keep up with in the age of the Internet. The ability to share ideas and customs with people across the planet instantly is something that we as a species have only had for a few decades. 

Video game culture in particular, is a very recent phenomenon. The industry itself is a little over 50 years old. So, it’s not a stretch to say that whether you like or hate certain elements of video game culture, these are still the early days for this medium. 

As someone who has spent more than two decades engaging with the video game industry and community at large, I can safely say that video game culture is no different from standard human culture. There’s a few good ideas in there, a few bad, and a whole lot of ambiguous ones. It’s up to each individual to interpret these ideas for themselves.

In this chapter, I give you my interpretation of video game culture. It is not my goal to convince you to love or hate the world of video games, but hopefully, this chapter will present a balanced view that will help you come up with your own interpretation of this strange world.

## Community

Video games have always been a social activity. Most games have dedicated online communities built around them, and *Gaming* is a popular category on most social media websites, where millions of people come together to discuss and share content about their favourite games.

From the very early days, starting in the ‘70s, playing games was seen as a group activity. Gamers used to gather in arcades, or wherever gaming machines were installed, and compete with or help each other beat the high scores on those machines.

When home consoles became popular in the ‘80s, whoever owned a console became the social darling of their neighbourhood. 

In the ‘90s, with the start of the Internet era, people became lazier and mostly sat in their own houses, but still talked to one another over the Internet, while playing their favourite games.

In the 21st century, it has become the norm to have social activities built into a gaming routine. Groups of friends or acquaintances form their own dedicated social hubs on apps such as Discord, or WhatsApp, and constantly plan their next gaming sessions. 

Larger community hubs like Reddit allow players of a particular game or genre to come together and share their love (or hate) for certain games or trends taking place in the industry.

The rise of streaming services such as Twitch and YouTube allowed players to watch their favourite streaming star play games and entertain an audience in real-time. This eventually became a full-time career for a lot of people.

Then there are tales of more tight-knit groups of friends taking it a step further, and designing their real lives to suit their gaming lifestyles, sometimes even choosing to live together in a shared space. 

All this is to say that the video game community is full of options for a lifestyle that enables you to play games at your own pace. 

There are certainly a lot of people who prefer not to interact with anyone else, and enjoy playing single-player games on their own. If they get stuck at some point, it is likely that they will watch a YouTube video that offers a solution, or they will find a text guide on a gaming website. This indirect interaction was also made possible by a community member, who took the time to record that video, or write that guide.

As we will see in the chapter about the dangers of video games, the gaming community can offer both, a positive, and a severely negative experience to its members. Unfortunately, this applies to online communities in general, so it is best to proceed with caution.

Those who put in the effort to find a kind and welcoming community, often find that video games are best enjoyed when playing together with a group of like-minded people. 


## Competitions

Not everyone wants to play video games for competitive reasons, but for those that do, these are really exciting times to be a part of eSports culture. 

This is an area of gaming that I am personally not too familiar with, but I have spent a considerable amount of time trying to understand it.

It all boils down to getting good at a certain game and looking for ways to keep improving. Everything else that happens in this part of the gaming world revolves around this concept of constant improvement. 

This explains why the average eSports player usually, but not always, behaves a bit differently compared to other people. These behavioural patterns vary, but it is not uncommon to expect eSports players to speak with a lot of enthusiasm and energy about their craft.

As for other aspects of eSports culture, I cannot offer much on the subject, as I have never personally attended an eSports tournament in-person. I can appreciate the skill and talent on display in these events, but despite trying to watch a few tournaments, I have never really connected with this part of gaming culture. However, from an outsider’s perspective, I do appreciate and respect the impact it has had on the larger gaming community. 

## Content 

Now let us look at how content plays a key role in shaping video game culture. This word can be interpreted in multiple ways, each of which we will explore in this section.

First, let’s talk about the content of the video games themselves. There are dozens of major genres, and hundreds of sub-genres in the video game market. If you can think of a kind of game you want to play, chances are, someone has made it. 

When the first lockdown for COVID-19 came around, I started playing a game called *The Last of Us*. It narrates an emotional story of people surviving in the aftermath of an infectious outbreak. One of the early levels in the game involve walking in the streets, with signs everywhere displaying timings of a daily curfew. It felt a bit surreal, sitting in a lockdown and playing a game that imagined what it would have been like if things had been so much worse. That game definitely made me appreciate the state of the real world, and helped me deal with the pandemic with a sense of optimism. 

Not every video game needs to be as complex and emotional like the *The Last of Us*. Sometimes it is just a bunch of cartoon characters playing a version of *Takeshi’s Castle*, as the game *Fall Guys* does. But my point is, once you look beyond the animated visuals, video game content can truly help you navigate the harsh realities of the world around you. Sometimes, you need to seek out a game to help you with something, and sometimes, you stumble across the right game at the right time. 

I feel it is this unspoken connection with the games’ content that makes a lot of us seek out new stories and new games all the time. We are eager to see what else this medium has to offer us.

Some of  us get so connected with the content of certain games that we end up creating our own versions of these games. This leads us to the next interpretation of the word, *content*, and that is, *User-Generated Content (UGC)*.

Before UGC had a formal term, it mostly consisted of modifications, or *mods*, that some enthusiasts made for their favourite games. Titles like *Doom*, and *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* have some large modding communities, which churn out new content for these games, decades after the original developers have stopped releasing official updates. 

However, creating mods often required learning to use specialied tools, which had a steep learning curve. Thus, it was only a small group of people who used to create mods.

The modern concept of UGC enables anyone with the time and interest, to build content for certain games. Some popular examples of games/services with UGC tools available include *Roblox, Fortnite,* and *Minecraft*. These applications make it possible for users to build levels and sometimes even complete games using relatively simple tools. 

Most of the time, the people who engage with UGC are not necessarily expecting to make money or gain Internet fame points. They are simply creating something to share with their group of friends and family. Building something, no matter how small, gives them a sense of satisfaction, which is much better than playing a game created by someone else.  

The third interpretation of content refers to the relatively new career path of *content creation*.  This refers to the creation of online media, including text, audio and video content, which is then shared on various social media platforms. 

In the context of video games, content creators are largely found on two platforms - Twitch, and YouTube. 

Twitch, a streaming service that was founded in 2011, single-handedly changed the way publishers felt about marketing their games. It allows anyone with a decent gaming set-up to start streaming their gameplay to a live audience, while optionally using a camera to appear in front of their audience and interact with them in real time.

Initially, publishers and developers were scared. They noticed people watching live streams of entire games being played, and wondered if this would negatively impact their sales. But slowly, they realised that the more people that watched these streams, the more their sales started to grow.

The secret sauce was once again that magical word, *community*. Once a potential buyer watched someone play a game, and then saw other people reacting to the gameplay in the comments, they were encouraged to participate in the discussion, and eventually buy the game themselves to feel included in the larger conversation around it. 

YouTube offered a similar, but slightly different experience. Once people could start uploading longer videos onto the platform, “Let’s Plays” became a popular format of content, wherein one would upload clips of a long gameplay session, often commentating along the way. This was a whole new way of experiencing video game content, which once again, stunned publishers. Here was their entire game, uploaded onto YouTube on the launch day, and yet these videos were leading to sales.

Rather than fight these platforms, publishers decided to embrace them, and today, content creators play a key role in the discovery and marketing of several games. This has proven to be especially useful to the developers of smaller games, who usually do not have a dedicated marketing budget. But if they are able to convince a handful of popular content creators to stream or make videos about their game, these developers are able to witness huge sales numbers at launch.

To put it all together, video game content can be used, interpreted, created, and enjoyed in multiple ways, allowing the video game community at large to express their creativity, interact with other members of the community, and appreciate the medium as a whole. 


## Cosplay

*Costume play*, or Cosplay for short, is not unique to video game culture. Dressing in costumes and showing up at special occasions has been a part of human culture in general since as far back as the 15th century.

In the modern era, comic-book and film fans have been known to embrace cosplay throughout the 20th century.

Naturally, when video games started getting more complex and started including unique and memorable characters, the concept of cosplay was embraced by the gaming community as well, and it became a staple of several gaming conventions and other events.

Showing up for an event dressed as a video game character is the easy part. There’s a lot of planning and hard work that goes into preparing the costume, and then executing that plan in time for the event.

There are professional cosplayers who take this craft one step further, and share various costumes on the Internet throughout the year, whether to showcase their love for certain characters, or merely to showcase innovative ideas in their craftsmanship. 

Occasionally, crafting a costume for a certain character can require more hours than it would take to play the entire game in which the character appears. The people who prepare such intricate costumes are in love with this concept, and video games are only a secondary means for them to practice their craft.

Even the artists who actually design these characters are now keeping the concept of cosplay in mind, by being careful not to include any elements in their design that would be impossible to recreate in real life. That said, expert cosplayers always find a way around even the most complex character designs. 

Similar to eSports, this is one part of video game culture that I do not participate in personally, but have understood enough to respect and appreciate a lot. 

## Conventions

I consume content other than video games, if only occasionally. I read books, watch TV and movies. I can’t remember the last time I stayed up until midnight to watch an announcement about an upcoming book, TV show or movie. I usually just watch the trailers for digital media whenever they appear on YouTube, and in the case of books, I stumble  upon some recommendation and end up buying the book myself.

I looked around and realised that the concept of having conventions designed to showcase upcoming products is somewhat unique to the world of video games. And over the years, this concept has become a crucial part of video game culture.

Of course, conventions are present across other media and industries. In fact, it was at a convention related to the electronics industry that the first known gaming convention got started. The annual *Consumer Electronics Show (CES)* started to include a section dedicated to video games in the early ‘90s.

This part of CES was so popular that in 1995, a separate convention for video games was held, titled the *Electronic Entertainment Expo* (E3). Originally held as a trade event targeting publishers, developers and other business segments of the industry, E3 soon started attracting the attention of the general public as well. This was because E3 gradually became the show where all the major publishers would gather to announce some of their biggest projects for the year and beyond.

Soon, the concept of holding a convention to showcase demos and interact with developers and other members of the community grew in popularity, leading to the creation of other well-known conventions. These included the *Tokyo Game Show, Gamescom*, and *Penny Arcade Expo* (PAX). A few publishers started holding conventions dedicated exclusively to their company’s games. Some examples of these include *BlizzCon* from Blizzard Entertainment, and *TennoCon* from Digital Extremes. 

Apart from the opportunity to try out demos for upcoming games, conventions provide fans a chance to interact with developers, at various talks and panels that some of these events include. 

As mentioned earlier, conventions feature several Cosplay events, for which professional cosplayers prepare for many months in advance.

Most of all, fans enjoy visiting conventions to bask in the energy generated by their fellow gamers. Sitting at home and playing a game is enjoyable on its own, but meeting a group of people sharing the same enthusiasm as yours, while watching some of them dressed as your favourite characters, is truly a memorable experience.

The most recent innovation to the convention format is to include an awards show, which is held in the form of the annual *The Game Awards* show. While award shows existed before, this new show provided the general audience an experience similar to watching the Academy Awards show for movies. 

As conventions evolve over the years, they will continue to remain an integral part of gaming culture, and give members of the community an opportunity to share their love for the medium with fellow gamers. 

## Cross-Media

Ask any person who plays games for more than ten hours a week if they would consider reading a book, and it is very likely that they would say no. I don’t exactly have the data to prove it, but generally speaking, people who play a lot of games do not have much time to read books or consume other media.

However, anecdotal evidence doesn’t work in the real world. The people who have actually spent time and money doing the research have found out that having a multimedia presence is good for the brand awareness of a product, whether it is a movie, or a video game property. 

This is why for several years, video games have had tie-ins with books, comic books and of course, movies. These additional media allow fans of certain games to spend more time interacting with their favourite characters or stories.

Movies in particular, have had a love-hate relationship with the video game industry. The earliest movies to be based on video games didn’t exactly set the box office on fire. *Super Mario Bros.* (1993) and *Street Fighter* (1994) were movies with interesting attempts, but they flopped hard.

But the studios kept trying, and eventually we started seeing some half-decent concepts. The *Resident Evil* and *Tomb Raider* series of movies in particular, showed some promise at the box office to keep the dream of video game movies alive. 

Eventually, Hollywood started to build a formula for making successful movies based on video games, and we got some commercial hits such as *Detective Pikachu* (2019),  *Sonic the Hedgehog* (2020) and *The Mario Bros. Movie* (2023). Of course, for every major success, there’s still the occasional flop like *Borderlands* (2024), but we have certainly come a long way. 

Further, streaming services started to join the bandwagon, with game based shows such as *The Witcher*, *The Last of Us*, and *Fallout* finding great success among critics and the general audience.  Quick note about *The Witcher*, it started life as a series of books, then became a successful video game franchise, and is now a major Netflix show. It is perhaps the best example of a multimedia product that we can get right now. 

This cross-media partnership works the other way as well. Several movie and TV franchises have made guest appearances in video games such as *Fortnite*, as part of a promotional tour.

Speaking of *Fortnite*, it has enabled real musicians to host live concerts within the game, further blurring the line between games and real life events. 

In September 2024, Bungie announced that to celebrate the tenth anniversary of their well-known game franchise, *Destiny*, the company would organise art exhibitions across three cities, showcasing art from the *Destiny* games. 

Then there are the numerous real life concerts that are held each year, celebrating music from popular games. 

To recap, video game content has now influenced books, TV, movies, concerts and even art exhibitions! That is a good summary of the extent to which video game culture has made its presence felt worldwide. 

## Conclusion

Video games are an interactive medium. The players is asked to engage with the game in order to make progress. Likewise, most aspects of video game culture are interactive. Whether it is viewers on Twitch interacting in real time with the streamers, or a new player seeking help from a random YouTube video or Reddit post, the members of this community are used to reaching out and helping one another. There’s a lot of room for improvement, as we shall see in the chapter about the dangers of this medium, but on any day, it’s much better to focus on the glass being half-full.
