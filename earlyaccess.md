# Early Access

Thank you for picking up this book and reading the first page. Hopefully, you will find the book interesting enough to read a few more pages.

Since this is a book about video games, it is only fitting that I am using the *Early Access* model to write it. If you are unaware, this is a trend in the video game market where a developer chooses to release their in-progress game into the market early, in order to get feedback, and more importantly, to secure funds to continue developing the game.

While I am not seeking funds to finish writing this book, I would indeed appreciate some feedback that will help me improve and eventually finish the book. However, I do have another reason for this early release.

I have been working on this book since 2020. Writing this book was partly how I distracted myself from the pandemic. My intention was to provide an introduction to the world of video games, to anyone who was interested to learn more about this industry, but was either not too familiar with it, or has had limited experience playing games. 

Over the years, the book grew in size, but I was nowhere close to finishing it. In 2024, I made a dedicated effort to wrap it up, but unfortunately, it was not meant to be. Enter the early access model.

I realised that what I had written so far mostly consisted of  general information about the industry that was freely available over the Internet. I essentially curated the important bits and put them together, which, I feel is worth your time. The parts of the book that are still pending, require additional research and some dedicated writing sessions, which will require additional time.

That is why I am releasing this early access version of the book. The online version of this edition will be completely free, and I am also getting a limited set of books printed, if only to satisfy my selfish desire to actually hold my book. 

Since this is not a complete book, there are some things to take note of.

- The starting chapter introduces the concept that I was aiming to build upon, which is to imagine the video game industry as a country of its own, with distinct states functioning independent of each other, while also coming together to build the country as a whole. This concept requires a bit more work, which is why it is not mentioned in any of the other chapters. However, I still wanted to introduce the concept, as I feel it helps us understand the *state* of the industry as it exists in the year 2024.
- The references section is not included. While I have saved the sources for the facts I have used in the book, cross-checking and formatting these references is a time-consuming task, and given my self-imposed deadline to release this edition, I have chosen to skip this section. If you wish to double check any information mentioned in this book, please consult the world’s best known search engine for now.
- The book’s structure is uneven. There are two huge chapters, and a few smaller ones in between. This may make the pace a bit rough, but I hope to improve this aspect in the final version, by splitting up the mega chapters into smaller ones.
- Your feedback matters! No matter how much of this book you choose to read, please take a few more seconds of your time to let me know what you think of it. Whether it’s the content itself, the pacing, or the general feel of the book, any and all feedback will be helpful in improving the final product. 
- If you only have time to read one chapter, please read the first one, titled, *Tutorial*. It provides a concise summary of the various topics discussed in the book, and gives you a quick overview of the video game industry.

Well, you did it. You finished reading the first few pages of the book. You get 10 points!

Now, why don’t you actually start reading the book by proceeding to the first chapter?
