# Money

Talking about money is a touchy topic. As a society, we have laid down certain rules which require all of us to earn money in order to fulfill our basic needs. And yet, we have also somehow made it a “dirty” thing to talk about money. Yes, there are people who take this pursuit for money too far and lose sight of their original goals, but most people just want to earn enough to pay their bills and lead a peaceful life. 

This chapter talks about making money in the video game industry. And let me start with a disclaimer: the information provided here is for educational purposes only. I am not an expert in any of the career paths mentioned here. In fact, I have only recently started pursuing one of these paths - game development - and expect to wait a few years to see the results of my efforts. You might wonder what usually drives such a decision to pursue a career in a high-risk industry? The answer is a word that is mentioned quite often in such conversations: *passion*.

Turning your passion, or hobby into your career is a risky proposition. No matter how you imagine you might love your day-to-day work, there will always other factors in play that might end up making you hate your job. The same applies to the world of video games. 

If you like playing video games, you might get excited about the concept of earning money by choosing one of the careers available in this industry. For instance, many people have the romantic idea of becoming an esports athlete, or a Twitch/YouTube streamer who plays games all day, and earns a lot of money in the process.

Ask any person who has achieved success in these career paths, and they will mention the hundreds of hours of work they have put in *not* playing games, in order to become successful. Not everyone has the capability to withstand the challenges that crop up behind the scenes. This is not to discourage anyone from pursuing these career paths, but it is necessary to be aware of the many risks and requirements involved with each of them. That is what this chapter is all about. 

We will explore five career paths, which I feel are the ones which offer the right mix of being enjoyable, challenging, and financially lucrative at the same time. Finding success with these options is not easy, but for those who persevere, there is a proven path to making an honest living using these career paths.

## Game Development 

Developing games is probably one of the most rewarding, and also one of the most frustrating career paths you can choose in this industry. Experienced developers have frequently remarked that any video game being ready for launch is nothing short of a miracle. 

Even the most simplest of games have so many interconnected systems running in the background that it is difficult to predict how and when one or more of them may cause performance issues, commonly known as *bugs*. 

For developers who manage to withstand numerous obstacles and squash most of the bugs, releasing a game into the market is only half the battle won. The other half is convincing players to actually buy, or play their game. Among the thousands of games that get released each year, a precious few manage to find enough players to get a small return on their investment. Even fewer get to see a decent profit.

So, it’s fair to say that if earning money is your primary motivation to enter this industry, developing games may not be the best path for you. However, if you are inspired enough to make a game in order to share a unique experience with your potential audience, or to test the limits of your own skills, developing games can offer a truly satisfying experience, similar to other career paths that involve creating something from scratch.

With all that said, let us now take a look at how games are made. Do keep in mind that this is a very simplified version of the game development process, meant to serve as an introduction. Each of the following steps has many finer details to keep in mind before actually starting the process. For example, we do not even discuss about game engines and the myriad of other tools used in the game development process. If you are interested in learning more about any of these steps, make sure to seek guidance from an experienced game developer. 

### Planning

The first step is to decide what kind of game you’re going to make. Just like an architect would first build some blueprints before actually calling in the construction team, a game needs to have a proper plan set in place before writing the first of code.

In the planning phase, the *game designer* puts down all their plans on how the game would work. This could include details such as the game’s theme, genre, the number of characters, what sort of mechanics to include, whether it’s going to be a gameplay-heavy title or a story-driven game, and so on. 

These plans are normally put down on paper (digital or  otherwise) in a document called the *Game Design Document* (GDD). This document serves as a guide for the entire team during the development process. 

### Pre-production

In the pre-production phase, the designer works with artists and programmers to create simple prototypes to visualise how the game’s various systems would work. These prototypes do not contain any complex assets, and are meant to be built in a short period of time, so that multiple designs can be tested quickly.

Once a satisfactory prototype has been tested and approved, the limitations of each department are clearly defined. This is to ensure that all the plans defined in the GDD can actually be implemented. You don’t want to spend a year building most of the game and then realising that your final level can’t actually be built on time.

After every department is confident that the GDD can be fully implemented, a production schedule is drawn up, which defines how each component of the game will be built.

### Production

The production phase is when everyone basically does their jobs. The artists create all of the art assets, such as characters, backgrounds, and all the numerous objects that appear in the game. The animators add animations to all the required objects, bringing them to life. The writers write down the game’s script, as well as all the dialogue and other text that appears in the game. The musicians compose all the sound effects and music that need to be used in the game. The programmers write code that takes all of the game’s components together and makes it function like a video game.

That was a huge simplification of what actually happens in the production phase, but it does provide a gist. In reality, things rarely go according to plan. While the GDD is still essential to get started, the production phase usually reveals several small or big problems that require changes to the original plan. Or, the original plan might be good, but could require more time than originally scheduled. In short, whatever can go wrong, will likely go wrong in the production phase.

At the end of all of it though, an early version of the game, with all of the bells and whistles, will be ready for the next step.

### Testing

 While technically, the game is constantly tested during production, the dedicated testing phase is when people other than the developers sit down and play the game all day, every day. 

Testing is often seen as a joyous task, and before the age of Twitch/YouTube, it was seen as the only job where you could get paid for playing games. 

However, testing is actually a serious and quite important task, which *can* lead to fun, but mostly involves performing repetitive tasks that can become boring. 

Testing is done to ensure that the game works as intended, and that includes every level, every character, every piece of dialogue, and whatever else is present in the game. It is important to note that testers find and remove most of the biggest bugs before the game is ever released to the public. 

However, depending on the size of the game, it might not be humanly possible to detect every single bug before the game’s launch. Also, even if they are aware of certain bugs, the development team might not have enough time to fix everything, and they prioritise the larger bugs first, and postpone fixing minor issues for later. This is why large, open-world games often release with many bugs on day one. It’s not as if testers never played those games, or that those bugs were never found. It’s simply that there was not enough time to find and fix everything. 

### Post-Production/Launch/Post-Launch

After the testing phase, a game may have different things left to do, depending on whether it is a live-service game or a regular game. In case of a live-service game, the work essentially never ends, even after launch. There is always new content to build, test and release, all while fixing bugs from older releases.

For regular games, which are deemed “completed” once they launch, the post-production phase involves finalising all the content in the game. No new content is created, and all of the existing content is polished to ensure a good user experience. After the team feels the game is ready to be played by the general public, that version of the game, called a *build*, is packaged as the release build, and is eventually sent for launch.

After the game’s launch, new bugs will inevitably be discovered and reported by players, and then the team spends a bit more time fixing them, before moving on to their next project.

And that, in a nutshell, was the entire game development process. Depending on whether you’re working alone, in a small team, or at a large studio, these steps may change quite a bit, but the concept remains the same: Plan everything from the start, begin production, watch those plans unravel, make everything come together at the end, launch the game, and say your prayers. 

The reward for putting up with such a stressful task is that a product you created will be played and enjoyed by a worldwide audience. Even better, if the game is well-received, it sets you up for some passive income for several years. Unlike esports athletes or content creators, who have to show up at their job almost everyday if they want to see continued revenue, game developers can live off of the earnings of a single hit game for the rest of their lives.  And that explains why it is such a competitive, and highly lucrative career path.
