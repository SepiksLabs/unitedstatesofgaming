# Money

Talking about money is a touchy topic. As a society, we have laid down certain rules which require all of us to earn money in order to fulfill our basic needs. And yet, we have also somehow made it a “dirty” thing to talk about money. Yes, there are people who take this pursuit for money too far and lose sight of their original goals, but most people just want to earn enough to pay their bills and lead a peaceful life. 

This chapter talks about making money in the video game industry. And let me start with a disclaimer: the information provided here is for educational purposes only. I am not an expert in any of the career paths mentioned here. In fact, I have only recently started pursuing one of these paths - game development - and expect to wait a few years to see the results of my efforts. You might wonder what usually drives such a decision to pursue a career in a high-risk industry? The answer is a word that is mentioned quite often in such conversations: *passion*.

Turning your passion, or hobby into your career is a risky proposition. No matter how you imagine you might love your day-to-day work, there will always other factors in play that might end up making you hate your job. The same applies to the world of video games. 

If you like playing video games, you might get excited about the concept of earning money by choosing one of the careers available in this industry. For instance, many people have the romantic idea of becoming an esports athlete, or a Twitch/YouTube streamer who plays games all day, and earns a lot of money in the process.

Ask any person who has achieved success in these career paths, and they will mention the hundreds of hours of work they have put in *not* playing games, in order to become successful. Not everyone has the capability to withstand the challenges that crop up behind the scenes. This is not to discourage anyone from pursuing these career paths, but it is necessary to be aware of the many risks and requirements involved with each of them. That is what this chapter is all about. 

We will explore four career paths, which I feel are the ones which offer the right mix of being enjoyable, challenging, and financially lucrative at the same time. Finding success with these options is not easy, but for those who persevere, there is a proven path to making an honest living using these career paths.

## Game Development 

Developing games is probably one of the most rewarding, and also one of the most frustrating career paths you can choose in this industry. Experienced developers have frequently remarked that any video game being ready for launch is nothing short of a miracle. 

Even the most simplest of games have so many interconnected systems running in the background that it is difficult to predict how and when one or more of them may cause performance issues, commonly known as *bugs*. 

For developers who manage to withstand numerous obstacles and squash most of the bugs, releasing a game into the market is only half the battle won. The other half is convincing players to actually buy, or play their game. Among the thousands of games that get released each year, a precious few manage to find enough players to get a small return on their investment. Even fewer get to see a decent profit.

So, it’s fair to say that if earning money is your primary motivation to enter this industry, developing games may not be the best path for you. However, if you are inspired enough to make a game in order to share a unique experience with your potential audience, or to test the limits of your own skills, developing games can offer a truly satisfying experience, similar to other career paths that involve creating something from scratch.

With all that said, let us now take a look at how games are made. Do keep in mind that this is a very simplified version of the game development process, meant to serve as an introduction. Each of the following steps has many finer details to keep in mind before actually starting the process. For example, we do not even discuss about game engines and the myriad of other tools used in the game development process. If you are interested in learning more about any of these steps, make sure to seek guidance from an experienced game developer. 

### Planning

The first step is to decide what kind of game you’re going to make. Just like an architect would first build some blueprints before actually calling in the construction team, a game needs to have a proper plan set in place before writing the first of code.

In the planning phase, the *game designer* puts down all their plans on how the game would work. This could include details such as the game’s theme, genre, the number of characters, what sort of mechanics to include, whether it’s going to be a gameplay-heavy title or a story-driven game, and so on. 

These plans are normally put down on paper (digital or  otherwise) in a document called the *Game Design Document* (GDD). This document serves as a guide for the entire team during the development process. 

### Pre-production

In the pre-production phase, the designer works with artists and programmers to create simple prototypes to visualise how the game’s various systems would work. These prototypes do not contain any complex assets, and are meant to be built in a short period of time, so that multiple designs can be tested quickly.

Once a satisfactory prototype has been tested and approved, the limitations of each department are clearly defined. This is to ensure that all the plans defined in the GDD can actually be implemented. You don’t want to spend a year building most of the game and then realising that your final level can’t actually be built on time.

After every department is confident that the GDD can be fully implemented, a production schedule is drawn up, which defines how each component of the game will be built.

### Production

The production phase is when everyone basically does their jobs. The artists create all of the art assets, such as characters, backgrounds, and all the numerous objects that appear in the game. The animators add animations to all the required objects, bringing them to life. The writers write down the game’s script, as well as all the dialogue and other text that appears in the game. The musicians compose all the sound effects and music that need to be used in the game. The programmers write code that takes all of the game’s components together and makes it function like a video game.

That was a huge simplification of what actually happens in the production phase, but it does provide a gist. In reality, things rarely go according to plan. While the GDD is still essential to get started, the production phase usually reveals several small or big problems that require changes to the original plan. Or, the original plan might be good, but could require more time than originally scheduled. In short, whatever can go wrong, will likely go wrong in the production phase.

At the end of all of it though, an early version of the game, with all of the bells and whistles, will be ready for the next step.

### Testing

 While technically, the game is constantly tested during production, the dedicated testing phase is when people other than the developers sit down and play the game all day, every day. 

Testing is often seen as a joyous task, and before the age of Twitch/YouTube, it was seen as the only job where you could get paid for playing games. 

However, testing is actually a serious and quite important task, which *can* lead to fun, but mostly involves performing repetitive tasks that can become boring. 

Testing is done to ensure that the game works as intended, and that includes every level, every character, every piece of dialogue, and whatever else is present in the game. It is important to note that testers find and remove most of the biggest bugs before the game is ever released to the public. 

However, depending on the size of the game, it might not be humanly possible to detect every single bug before the game’s launch. Also, even if they are aware of certain bugs, the development team might not have enough time to fix everything, and they prioritise the larger bugs first, and postpone fixing minor issues for later. This is why large, open-world games often release with many bugs on day one. It’s not as if testers never played those games, or that those bugs were never found. It’s simply that there was not enough time to find and fix everything. 

### Post-Production/Launch/Post-Launch

After the testing phase, a game may have different things left to do, depending on whether it is a live-service game or a regular game. In case of a live-service game, the work essentially never ends, even after launch. There is always new content to build, test and release, all while fixing bugs from older releases.

For regular games, which are deemed “completed” once they launch, the post-production phase involves finalising all the content in the game. No new content is created, and all of the existing content is polished to ensure a good user experience. After the team feels the game is ready to be played by the general public, that version of the game, called a *build*, is packaged as the release build, and is eventually sent for launch.

After the game’s launch, new bugs will inevitably be discovered and reported by players, and then the team spends a bit more time fixing them, before moving on to their next project.

And that, in a nutshell, was the entire game development process. Depending on whether you’re working alone, in a small team, or at a large studio, these steps may change quite a bit, but the concept remains the same: Plan everything from the start, begin production, watch those plans unravel, make everything come together at the end, launch the game, and say your prayers. 

The reward for putting up with such a stressful task is that a product you created will be played and enjoyed by a worldwide audience. Even better, if the game is well-received, it sets you up for some passive income for several years. Unlike esports athletes or content creators, who have to show up at their job almost everyday if they want to see continued revenue, game developers can live off of the earnings of a single hit game for the rest of their lives.  And that explains why it is such a competitive, and highly lucrative career path.

## Game Publishing

If making a game was the tough part, selling it to an interested audience is even tougher. Relatively speaking, it is easier to build a marketing plan than it is to build a game from scratch, but the argument here is that making a good game isn’t enough. Knowing how to deliver it to the proper audience is also an important process. This is where a game publisher comes in.

Once again, the following is going to offer a very simplified description of what a game publisher does. If you wish to learn more about this process in detail, please spend some more time researching about this process.

Simply put, a game publisher supports a developer by offering them whatever they need to bring their game to the market. Every contract signed between a publisher and a developer is unique, and has various terms and clauses to suit the needs of both parties. 

Here are a few of the various ways in which a publisher can support a developer.

### Funding

At the earliest stages of development, a publisher can offer enough funding to the developer in order to build the game. Apart from cold hard cash, a publisher can also provide office space, software licenses, and anything else that the developer may require to bring their game to life. The publisher thus acts as an investor, hoping to get a return on their investment once the game hits the market.

### Marketing

Games are marketed at various stages of their development. Some projects are announced as soon as they begin production, some are revealed closer to the game’s launch, while some games are announced directly on their launch date, usually as a surprise to an excited audience. 

It is part of the publisher’s role to decide on the marketing strategy of the game, based on its genre and market demand. Publishers can merely assist or entirely take over the complete marketing plan for various games. They hire dedicated community managers to interact with fans and to keep them updated about the game’s development progress. And as the game approaches its launch, publishers work with journalists and online influencers to play their games early, and release a review for their respective audiences.

For AAA games, the budget for such marketing campaigns can run into the tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. Publishers bear such huge costs, because with the right game, they can get a positive return on their investment on the very day of the game’s launch.

### Distribution

Although this part is quickly becoming irrelevant, a publisher can help a game get a physical release, i.e., the game will be sold on discs. This process involves designing and manufacturing the discs, and then getting them onto store shelves at various retail stores, as well as getting listed on popular e-commerce websites. 

### Development Support

Depending on the size of the publisher, they may be able to provide support in the actual development of the game. This includes things like localisation, testing, and any required technical support, such as porting the game to multiple platforms. For newer developers, having the guidance of an experienced publisher for such tasks can greatly cut down on the time required to bring the game to market. 

### Legal and Regulatory Support

Selling a video game across multiple platforms can quickly become a legal mess, requiring multiple contracts to be signed with platform holders, distributors and other service providers. 

Then there are things like getting an age rating for your game from multiple age-rating boards, who are spread across different countries. 

A publisher can help the developer navigate through all such legal and regulatory requirements, so that the developer can focus on building the game and not worry about meeting a group of bureaucrats and lawyers every day. 

### Analytics

Once a game crosses all the hurdles and launches into the market, the publisher’s role is not done yet. They can continue helping the developer gain insight over their game’s performance, by providing them various metrics, such as sales, the average time that players spend playing their games, the geographical split in their player base, and so on. This information will then help the developer optimise their current or future games so that they have the best chance of success.

As you can see, a publisher can offer end-to-end support to help the developer bring their game to market. Each of the support roles mentioned above are provided by specialists. So, if you think you might be interested in a career in game publishing, you can choose one of the roles mentioned above and try to get hired at a publishing company. Once you’re inside, you can keep learning about all the other aspects of the business, and eventually rise to the top of the corporate ladder.

In other words, working at a game publisher company is pretty similar to most other standard desk jobs. The key difference is that since you will be working in the video game industry, your work conversations will revolve a lot around video games, which isn’t such a bad thing.

## Esports

What does it take to be good at something? According to author Malcolm Gladwell, to become an expert at a skill, you need to practice it for at least 10,000 hours. It probably takes a few more hours than that to become a world-class esports athlete.

Esports used to be one of the most visible ways to earn money by playing games. Now it has been replaced by content creation, which has a lower barrier of entry. However, those who take a closer look will realise that if you are able to meet the high standards set by modern esports organisations, it is still a much more lucrative method to pursue a career in the industry.

Esports, or *Electronic Sports*,  is a blanket term used to refer to an organised form of competitive gaming, consisting of tournaments played in front of a live audience, similar to regular sports.

In theory, any video game can be played competitively, but a few are particularly designed with an esports structure in mind. These include popular First-Person Shooter (FPS) titles such as *Counter-Strike 2, Valorant*, and *Overwatch 2*, or Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) titles such as *League of Legends*, and *Dota 2.* There are games from other genres as well, such as *Fortnite* (Battle Royale), *FIFA* (Football Simulation), and *Gran Turismo 7* (Racing Simulation).

The organising bodies rely on various revenue streams such as sponsorships, advertising, ticket sales, merchandise sales and sale of broadcast rights, in order to bear the costs of organising tournaments worldwide. 

Esports athletes earn a living by signing contracts with professional teams, which grants them a salary, certain benefits, as well as a share in any potential prizes. 

Pursuing a career in esports as an athlete is certainly more straightforward now than before. You will need to pick a video game that has an active esports scene, and which you are good at. Then, find yourself a suitable team (which is easier said than done), participate in one of the numerous qualifying tournaments that are held at certain times of the year, and you will soon find your team climbing up the ladders at some of the most important tournaments.

Yet again, this is an oversimplification of the actual process. Unlike most of the other career paths, your success in esports depends on a combination of talent and luck. With the other careers, if you stick to a path long enough, you will find yourself making progress. 

But with esports, you either have to find success within your first few years in the circuit, or you will simply find yourself being outplayed by people younger than yourself, further making it difficult to succeed. 

That’s because age is your enemy in this career path. It’s not as if you will suddenly lose your talent once you start aging, but your responsibilities may go up over time, and you will find yourself with less time to practice, compared to when you were much younger.  

There are other jobs available in the esports world as well, but unless you have a natural passion for roles like casting (providing live commentary), there is not much financial incentive to pursue them. 

To throw in my personal opinion into the mix, I feel that pursuing a career in esports is extremely risky at the moment, maybe even more so than taking up game development. That’s because there are very few things that are under your control.

Esports athletes do not know if their chosen video game will continue attracting a worldwide audience each year, which is a key factor in determining whether esports tournaments are held or not. Except for the top 1% of players, everyone else is not really guaranteed to get salaries and other benefits, so it becomes an extremely cut-throat competition to reach the top and survive. And just like traditional sports, there is immense pressure to perform at your peak and earn as  much as you can before you hit a certain age, because there is no guarantee of what happens beyond that.

A few people do have that competitive edge that makes it really easy for them to survive under such conditions. For these select few, the world of esports offers many lucrative opportunities. If you wish to pursue a career here, you will first need to find out if you belong to that small minority of naturally talented athletes who can keep calm under pressure and perform consistently in front of a worldwide audience. 

For the rest of us, there’s no shame in accepting our limits and pursuing other career options, while cheering on our favourite players from the stands. 


## Content Creation

*Content Creation* is a term that applies to a wide range of disciplines. Broadly speaking, it involves creating content in the form of text, pictures, audio, video, or a combination of one or more of these formats. 

In the world of video games, content creators are primarily found on two platforms - *Twitch*, and *YouTube*. Secondary platforms include the usual list of social media apps, such as *Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat,* and so on. The primary platforms however, is where hundreds of people have built successful careers. Note that I said hundreds, and not thousands, although there are hundreds of thousands of people who have a presence on these platforms, trying to make it to the top.

Those at the top are able to enjoy a steady stream of income due to the size of their audience, which often measures in the hundreds of thousands, or millions. It takes time to build a dedicated audience of such a size, and even after putting in time and effort, it’s not a guaranteed thing. 

Imagine if YouTube guaranteed that everyone who uploaded a video to the platform daily for two years would automatically get a million subscribers. Suddenly, a lot more people would be motivated to take up YouTube as a career option! In reality, it doesn’t work like that. Some people are charming, knowledgeable, lucky, or all of them at once, to gain a massive audience in a short amount of time. The rest of us have to either give it an honest try and see what happens, or not try at all.

Anyway, for those who are interested in becoming a content creator in the realm of video games, there are two clear paths.

The first is to become a live streamer, which you can try on both major platforms, although Twitch is the platform of choice for the top streamers. Live streaming involves playing games of your choice, while offering live commentary, some kind of analysis, or whatever else you feel will attract an audience. Once you get enough people following your streams, Twitch will allow you to run ads on your stream, accept donations and monthly subscriptions, which are all direct revenue streams. Once you grow even larger, you may attract sponsors to your channel, who will pay you to showcase their brand on your streams. 

Live streaming is a physically and mentally demanding job. Not only do you need to keep your gameplay good enough for random viewers to remain interested, but you also need to pay attention to your chat window, incoming alerts about donations/subscriptions, and anything else that may be going on around you. The most successful streamers are live for up to 12 hours a day, for multiple days a week. It is not uncommon to stay live even longer over the weekends, since that is when a lot of your potential audience will have some free time.

If these conditions were not stressful enough, your income is heavily dependent on Twitch not changing any of the platform’s rules, which has happened in the past. Also, generally speaking, the unique appeal of interacting with a streamer online has worn off a bit. This is evident from multiple reports indicating that Twitch is slowly using users. Its popularity hasn’t crashed overnight, but the decline is visible to regular users.

The other big name in video game content creation, YouTube, offers a similar but slightly more relaxing experience. You can still do live streams on YouTube, but the major appeal with this platform are its regular videos. If you make a video that the audience considers to be worthy of their time, YouTube will usually keep recommending it to newer audiences for as long as possible, thus generating continuous income. 

The difficult part of course, is convincing an audience that your video is worth their time. You might pour in a lot of time and effort making the perfect video, but unless the audience deems it worthy, it will not have a lot of views in the long term. On the other hand, you might put up a low effort video that only took you a few minutes to make, and it could end up being one of the most watched videos on your channel.

That’s not to say success on YouTube is entirely random. If you spend enough time on the platform, you start noticing patterns among your more successful videos, and then you can try to replicate that success. The good news is, unlike Twitch, audiences are still spending a lot of time watching YouTube videos, especially in the gaming category.

When you become eligible for monetisation on YouTube, it brings along with it similar revenue opportunities as Twitch - advertisements, sponsorships, and paid subscriptions (called *memberships*) 

Also similar to Twitch, you will need to constantly be active on the platform to maintain your revenue stream. If you enjoy the process, it is quite rewarding to produce videos and then get feedback from your audience. If you treat it as a standard job that you *must* do in order to earn money, then you run the risk of getting burnt out, which will affect your content’s quality, leading to a loss in revenue. 

To summarise this section, content creation is certainly a lucrative career option. However, given the low barrier of entry, where just about anyone with access to a phone or computer can start a new channel, you can expect constant competition, and a lot of stress around your channel metrics.

These are not the *only* known paths to build a career in the industry. There are certainly other options, such as running a retail store selling video game discs and other merchandise, consulting, coaching, and maybe even more options that have not even been discovered yet. With the various tools available for free online, you are only limited by your imagination and time in discovering the next best way to make money in this industry.
