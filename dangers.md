# Danger

Danger (/ˈdeɪn(d)ʒə/)*noun*

*1. the possibility of suffering harm or injury.*

*2.the possibility of something unwelcome or unpleasant happening.*

As much as playing video games is fun, and engaging with the video game community is rewarding, it goes without saying that like any other hobby, and any other industry, there are some risks associated with video games as well.

A lot of these risks can be avoided by remembering the old adage, *Too much of anything is good for nothing*.

That said, being aware of these risks can helpful in identifying them, after which necessary steps can be taken to fight them. 

Here are some of the risks or dangers associated with video games, along with suggestions on how to deal with them.

## Addiction

Addicts rarely admit their problem. That’s because they believe they are in complete control of their issue. This usually signifies that they know their addiction is problematic, but they are unable to fight it. More importantly, they are unaware, or unwilling to accept that they are not in control.

Video games were not always designed to be addictive, but once companies discovered that by tweaking a few things in the core design they could get players *hooked* to any game, they began to intentionally add in elements that would trigger a person’s addictive tendencies. 

Most of these elements revolve around a concept called the *reward system*, which is hardwired into our brain. In simple terms, when the brain identifies that performing a certain action makes you happy, it triggers a neurotransmitter called *dopamine*, that gives you a sense of accomplishment. In other words, it makes you feel good. The more you repeat those actions, the more you train your brain to associate that action with being happy.  

Now let’s see how a video game might be designed to abuse this system. Logging into a game for the first time every day could trigger a random reward, simply called as a login reward. Right away, you feel satisfied that you are being *rewarded* for a simple action such as logging in. Over time, you may make it a habit to get this login reward every day, failing which you may feel anxious about missing out on the reward. This is a simple trick designed just to get you to interact with the game on a regular basis.

Once you have logged in, it is likely that you will engage with some of the other elements of the game. You may play for a while, or visit the in-game store to browse the new arrivals. Playing the game might involve being exposed to several elements that are designed to make you feel good - an enemy being defeated with a satisfying sound, a score counter going up, a celebratory screen congratulating you for making progress, a checklist showing how much progress you have made in the game since you started, and so on. All these elements give you a false sense of accomplishment, while in reality, you may become addicted to the game, unwilling to perform any other activities in real life until you have received what is commonly called a *dopamine hit*, or a regular dose of dopamine. 

The problem is, the longer you stick to this habit of interacting with dopamine-triggering elements, the longer it takes to get that dopamine hit. Over time, you will thus end up spending more time on the game, unconsciously waiting for something good to happen. Over an even longer period of time, usually after you have spent thousands of hours on the same time, you may eventually end up feeling entirely numb, not deriving any joy from the game at all. At that point, you will be logging in purely out of habit. 

This scenario may feel a bit dark, but it has indeed taken place numerous times, all over the world. It is part of the reason why the World Health Organisation has listed *Gaming Disorder* as an illness. People affected by this condition are unable to function in real life, and are constantly relying on their gaming habit to get through their day.

So how does one fight it? Well, to begin with, if you or someone you know is showing symptoms of video game addiction, the best course of action is to get some professional help. The suggestions given here only serve as a general pointer.

That said, here’s what one could possibly do to combat game addiction. First, avoid interacting with any game that:

- requires an Internet connection to play the game
- does not feature a single-player component
- contains a *battlepass*, or a *season pass*
- consists of *seasons* that change every few month, promising new content with each season
- contains an in-game store where you can spend real money
- has a daily login reward system

Getting addicted to games that do *not* feature the above elements is less likely, because single-player games are normally not designed to trick you into playing them more. They are designed to guide you till the end of the game, and they’re done. 

Sadly, some of the most popular games on the market are multiplayer games with some, or all of the above elements, which explains why video game addiction is a huge risk. However, if you identify these elements and train yourself to stay away from them, you can safely play these games without  being worried of getting addicted. It might take some practice to get there, but if it helps, think of it as a game, whose objective is to identify and avoid all the traps that designers set in the actual game that you’re playing!

Addiction is so dangerous that the rest of the risks listed in this chapter are all related to addiction in one way or the other.

## Bankruptcy

You may have heard this story multiple times: a person gets addicted to a certain game, and loses their life savings, or a child misuses their parents’ card and drains their bank account, and so on.

If you refer to the list of elements that can cause addiction as listed above, you may notice that it is only possible to get bankrupt playing video games if you engage with games that allow you to spend money inside the game.

If you play games that are either completely free, or those that require a one-time payment to purchase the game and then never ask you for money, there is no possibility of unknowingly losing your money.

The solution might seem simple, and it is. However, let us look some more into how games can use various systems to prompt players into spending real world money for fake, digital items.

The concept of generating money through a product is commonly referred to as *monetisation*. 

Good products have a healthy plan of monetisation; they ask the users for money, and offer something valuable in return, thus giving the users a valid reason to spend money. 

Bad products, on the other hand, indulge in what are usually referred to as *predatory* tactics, wherein the user is tricked into spending money, *believing* that they are getting something of value, but in reality, they either get something useless, or nothing at all.

The games that cause people to go bankrupt are bad products. They engage in one or more predatory tactics to monetise their user base. 

Before we learn about these tactics, it’s time to introduce another important term: *microtransactions*. Publishers have used the concept of microtransactions to generate billions of dollars in revenue, from seemingly simple games. 

For instance, one of the most popular puzzle games in the world, *Candy Crush Saga*, lures in people with its cute graphics and simple gameplay mechanics, but it silently pulls in millions of dollars in revenue *every day*, by using the concept of microtransactions.

As the name implies, microtransactions are tiny purchases, usually between a few cents to a few dollars each. They may be used for different reasons in-game. For instance, in *Candy Crush Saga*, you may require a certain fake currency to continue playing a level once you are out of moves. But to obtain this fake currency, you need to spend a tiny bit of real money, in order to get hundreds or even thousands of this fake currency, which then lets you keep playing. 

Over time, regular players hardly notice the amount of money they are spending on such games, and those tiny transactions add up to result in financial ruin.

But that’s not the only trick these games use to get you to open your wallet. 

Let’s talk about *battle passes*. This is a cunning bit of game design that not only encourages players to spend money regularly, but also forces them to spent almost all of their free time playing the game for which the pass was purchased. 

It works like this. Every few months, usually called a *season*, the game prompts players to purchase an in-game item called a battle pass. Doing so unlocks a progression mechanic spanning several levels, with each level offering a certain reward. These rewards range from in-game currencies, to cosmetic items that change the appearance of the players’ characters. Each battle pass comes with a time limit, running till the end of the next season (although a few games are generous enough to allow players to use the pass for as long as they want). 

To fully redeem all the rewards available in the pass, players are expected to play the game for a long time, often multiple hours per day. Not everyone can spare so much time, so they eventually realise they cannot “finish” the pass on time. This is when the game offers players the opportunity to unlock more levels on the pass by using virtual currency. If they do not have enough of the virtual currency, they are of course, prompted to purchase more from the in-game store. 

The only redeeming feature of these passes is that *most* games offer enough virtual currency as rewards to enable the players to purchase the next season’s pass. So, in theory, players only have to purchase the pass once, and then they can purchase future passes purely through gameplay. But for this to be possible, they need to spend hundreds of hours in the game every season. So it’s a choice between spending time or spending money, and since time is more valuable, a lot of people end up spending money.

The other tactic to generate revenue from games is by directly selling cosmetic items to players in exchange for real money. These items are usually available exclusively in the in-game store, and not as part of the battle pass. The prices for these items can range from a few dollars to more than a hundred dollars. While a majority of the player base usually ignore these, the target audience for these items is a small section of the player base who readily spends any amount of money on such things. The players belonging to this minority are informally called *whales*.

The final tactic that we will discuss is an old one, used only by games that are supported by large publishers. This tactic goes by numerous names, including *lootboxes*, and *gacha*. While there may be minor differences between them, the overlying concept is the same: players pay money for a *chance* to receive some rare quality in-game items. They are asked to cycle through some digital interface, usually appearing in the form of boxes, crates or similar containers. The opening of these containers in-game is usually accompanied by a shiny animation, causing the players to feel excited with anticipation of a good reward. 

This type of monetisation is on its way out due to its similarity with gambling, where the player does not know the outcome of their purchase beforehand. 

Similar to avoiding gaming addiction, financial ruin due to games can be completely avoided by staying clear of games that feature any of these monetisation models.

## Health

Next, let us talk about a different kind of risk, one that does not necessarily drain your bank account, but can cause several long term health issues.

Playing video games for multiple hours per day, over several days a month, can harm your physical health in several ways. To begin with, games can place a heavy strain on your eyes, making you feel tired and drained of energy after the sessions are over.

Players may also face some posture-related issues if they maintain poor posture while playing games. This includes back pain, neck pain and long-term issues related to the spine. 

Regular usage of keyboards, mice and controllers can also cause strain injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis. 

Further, if players do not get enough physical exercise, a common side effect of playing video games is obesity, which is caused due to a sedentary routine.

The list doesn’t stop there. Playing games at odd hours can lead to sleep deprivation and can interrupt your sleep cycles for a long time. 

All these are real risks associated with playing games, but all of them are easy to avoid by monitoring your own gaming routine. Dedicating some time to get physical exercise on a regular basis is a great way to avoid most of these health risks. 

As for avoiding disruptions to your sleep patterns, it is certainly convenient for most people to play at night, when they are least likely to be disturbed, but at some point, sleep has to be prioritised over gaming for the sake of your long-term health.

## Toxicity

The Internet is not a nice place. That’s just a fact, and there’s no way to avoid it. And since the gaming community is a subset of the larger Internet community, it is no surprise that there is a sizeable population of gamers who display toxic behaviour towards their fellow gamers. This includes behaviour such as cyberbulling, trolling, racism and hate speech. 

Being exposed to such people can quickly turn away anyone from gaming altogether. Children and teenagers are especially at risk of being exposed to such behaviour online, as it spreads faster among their peers.

The solution to escaping toxic behaviour online is well-known: *avoid and ignore*.  The first step is to avoid any known sources of toxic behaviour. This includes voice chat lobbies in most online games, as well as a few public forums. Most games have options to turn off voice chat entirely, or limit it to being enabled only for friends. Similarly, privacy settings allow users to avoid receiving being contacted by strangers.

The second step is to ignore any toxic behaviour you may encounter, accidentally or otherwise, since it is not practical to avoid all forms of such behaviour, unless you completely step away from the Internet. Most people who engage in such behaviour usually try to trigger a response out of their victims, and so, ignoring them in the first place is the ideal way to deal with them.

It is a bit unfortunate that the Internet cannot become a completely safe space for users to interact with each other. The number of bad actors are certainly fewer than the number of perfectly friendly people out there, but sadly, it is the bad actors who are usually the most vocal, and the most visible. 

So, at least until someone finds a better way to safely navigate the Internet, you can have a safe gaming experience by avoiding and ignoring known sources of toxic behaviour. 

## FOMO

*Fear of Missing Out* (FOMO) is a classic side-effect of interacting with any new technology. Social media apps are especially notorious for inculcating this habit in their users, and video games are no different. 

Most of the predatory tactics we discussed earlier - the seasonal mode, battle passes and in-store items - are all so successful because they use FOMO to manipulate players into interacting with these systems.

For instance, using the seasonal model, designers introduce a forced time limit for players to interact with their games. If the player has bought a battle pass, it must be completed before the season ends, or the player will *miss out* on dozens of “exciting rewards”, most of which end up being useless.  If an exciting new cosmetic item has appeared in the store, it is usually accompanied by a limited-time discount or purchase date, after which it will no longer be available to players, at least for a few weeks. This triggers the compulsive shopping behaviour that a lot of people have, and manipulates them into purchasing digital items that are essentially worthless.

Once again, the ideal way to counter these FOMO tactics is by avoiding games which use them. This is an effective solution, because if a game is not designed to constantly pitch new content, there is no risk of being affected by FOMO.

***

You might wonder if the most efficient solution to avoid all these risks is to avoid playing video games in the first place. While that would work, it is the equivalent of avoiding all worldly dangers by refusing to leave the house. 

Given the hectic work routine that most people have, you usually get a handful of hours per week to allocate to “entertainment”. There may be numerous activities that compete for that precious time. If you wish to allocate some or all of it to video games, then it only makes sense to use that time to play games that do not put your health and wealth at risk every time you log in.
